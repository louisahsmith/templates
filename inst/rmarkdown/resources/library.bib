abstract = {Introduction: This study investigated associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and child behaviors at ages 9-11 years and examine interaction by race and gender. Methods: The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Children and Young Adults surveys are U.S.-based, ongoing longitudinal studies, initiated in 1979 and 1986, respectively. Mothers (n=2,952) reported pregnancy and child (n=5,660) developmental information at multiple time points. Child total, internalizing, and externalizing problems at ages 9-11 years were assessed using the Behavior Problems Index (BPI), collected biennially until 2012. Associations between prepregnancy BMI and child BPI outcomes were examined, as well as two- and three-way interactions by race and gender. Analyses were conducted in 2017. Results: Boys whose mothers had higher prepregnancy weights exhibited higher total BPI and externalizing scores at ages 9-11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers. Boys with severely obese mothers had higher total BPI (mean difference=7.99, 95{\%} CI=3.53, 12.46) and externalizing (mean difference=5.77, 95{\%} CI=1.50, 10.04) scores. Prepregnancy underweight was associated with boys' higher total BPI (mean difference=2.34, 95{\%} CI=0.02, 4.66) and externalizing (mean difference=3.30, 95{\%} CI=0.69, 5.91); these associations were not significant in sensitivity analyses. No associations emerged for girls or internalizing problems. Two-way interactions by race and three-way interactions by race and gender were not significant. Conclusions: Maternal prepregnancy weight was associated with BPI level among boys. Boys with severely obese mothers exhibited markedly higher behavioral problems at ages 9-11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers, regardless of race. Maintaining healthy prepregnancy weight may be important for preventing boys' deleterious behavior outcomes in middle childhood.},

abstract = {Longitudinal studies play a prominent role in health, social and behavioral sciences as well as in the biological sciences, economics, and marketing. By following subjects over time, temporal changes in an outcome of interest can be directly observed and studied. An important question concerns the existence of distinct trajectory patterns. One way to determine these distinct patterns is through cluster analysis, which seeks to separate objects (subjects, patients, observational units) into homogeneous groups. Many methods have been adapted for longitudinal data, but almost all of them fail to explicitly group trajectories according to distinct pattern shapes. To fulﬁll the need for clustering based explicitly on shape, we propose vertically shifting the data by subtracting the subject-speciﬁc mean directly removes the level prior to ﬁtting a mixture modeling. This non-invertible transformation can result in singular covariance matrixes, which makes mixture model estimation difﬁcult. Despite the challenges, this method outperforms existing clustering methods in a simulation study},

abstract = {2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-(italic)p(/italic)-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin), a widespread environmental contaminant, has been shown to disrupt multiple endocrine pathways. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified TCDD as a known human carcinogen, primarily based on occupational studies of increased mortality from all cancers combined. Using data from the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS), we examined the association between individual serum TCDD levels and breast cancer risk in women residing around Seveso, Italy, in 1976, at the time of an industrial explosion that resulted in the highest known population exposure to TCDD. The SWHS cohort comprises 981 women who were infants to 40 years old in 1976, resided in the most contaminated areas at the time of the explosion, and had archived sera that was collected soon after the explosion. For each woman, serum TCDD exposure was measured by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Cancer cases were identified during interview and confirmed by medical record. At interview, 15 women (1.5{\%}) had been diagnosed with breast cancer and serum TCDD levels for cases ranged from 13 to 1,960 ppt. Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that the hazard ratio for breast cancer associated with a 10-fold increase in serum TCDD levels (log(subscript)10(/subscript) TCDD) was significantly increased to 2.1 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.0-4.6). Covariate-adjusted results were not different. Individual serum TCDD is significantly related with breast cancer incidence among women in the SWHS cohort. Continued follow-up of the cohort will help shed light on the possible role of TCDD in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.},

abstract = {As with other instrumental variable (IV) analyses, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies rest on strong assumptions. These assumptions are not routinely systematically evaluated in MR applications, although such evaluation could add to the credibility of MR analyses. In this article, the authors present several methods that are useful for evaluating the validity of an MR study. They apply these methods to a recent MR study that used fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype as an IV to estimate the effect of obesity on mental disorder. These approaches to evaluating assumptions for valid IV analyses are not fail-safe, in that there are situations where the approaches might either fail to identify a biased IV or inappropriately suggest that a valid IV is biased. Therefore, the authors describe the assumptions upon which the IV assessments rely. The methods they describe are relevant to any IV analysis, regardless of whether it is based on a genetic IV or other possible sources of exogenous variation. Methods that assess the IV assumptions are generally not conclusive, but routinely applying such methods is nonetheless likely to improve the scientific contributions of MR studies.},

Teachers rated inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in offspring. High scores were defined as at least one core symptom rated as 'severe' and two as 'present' (approximately 10{\%} of children scored in this range). Logistic regression and latent class analyses were used to examine maternal pregnancy weight in relation to children's ADHD core symptoms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Teacher rated 12 556 school-aged children. Gestational weight gain outside of the Institute of Medicine guidelines was not related to ADHD symptoms (below recommendations: odds ratio (OR): 0.96; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.14; above recommendations: OR: 0.98; 95{\%} CI: 0.82, 1.16).

"Extreme pre-pregnancy weight at both sides of the spectrum correlate with altered metabolic, hormonal or ovarian functioning, for example (1), which could play a role in fetal neurodevelopment.... Fetal brain development is also dependent on maternal energy supply during pregnany (11). Thus, it is possible that maternal weight gain could moderate the possible negative impact of extreme pre-pregnacny BMI."

"Stratified analyses showed that for women starting out pregnancy at normal weight or underweight, pregnancy weight gain did not significantly increase their offs of having a child with a high ADHD symptom score. However, for women with high pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain further increased their odds of having a child with a high ADHD symptom score."

"Lean women who experienced weight loss had increased risk for a high ADHD symptom score in their offspring (1.52) but that was not the case for overweight women."

"Non-adherence to the IOM recommendations was not significantly associated with an ADHD symptom score in offspring"

"Latent classification clearly showed that excessive pre-pregnacny BMI seems to be more important than weight gain during gestation for risk of a high ADHD symptom score in the offspring."

"ADHD has been mainly linked to dysfunction in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in genetic studies and recently some evidence points to dysfunctions in the same systems among overweight and obese women (33, 34). Thus, genetic predisposition could account for both overweight and ADHD symptoms."

"Perceived stress is related to caloric intake and ingestion of 'comfort food,' that is, with high fat and carbohydrate content. Indeed, weight gain and obesity are related to chronic stress (35). It is hypothesized that cortisol secretion in response to maternal-perceived stress affects fetal brain development. Evidence shows that perceived psychological stress by women during pregnancy is linked to ADHD symptoms in their children (23, 36). In this view, stress would be the predisposing factor and BMI would be on the causal pathway leading to ADHD symptoms in the offspring."

"It may be that the adipose tissue of overweight and obese women contains larger amounts of neurotoxins or lacks specific micronutrients that negatively affect fetal brain development."

"Adipose tissue is not inert, but synthesizes leptin according to fat stores and signals metabolic status to the brain. Both in non-pregnany and pregnant states, increasing BMI is related to increasing levels of leptin and is related to pathology with increased levels seen in pre-eclamptic and diabetic women. Data also point to the involvement of leptin in mood disturbances including stress (44). It is likely that one of the mechanisms linking maternal overweight and obesity in pregnacy to ADHD symptoms in the offspring involves leptin, due to its involvement in multiple functions."},

abstract = {Objectives: The objectives of this article are to demonstrate that the obesity paradox may be explained by collider stratification bias and to estimate the biasing effects of unmeasured common causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality on the observed obesity-mortality relationship. Methods: We use directed acyclic graphs, regression modeling, and sensitivity analyses to explore whether the observed protective effect of obesity among individuals with CVD can be plausibly attributed to selection bias. Data from the third National Health and Examination Survey was used for the analyses. Results: The adjusted total effect of obesity on mortality was a risk difference (RD) of 0.03 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.05). However, the controlled direct effect of obesity on mortality among individuals without CVD was RD=0.03 (95{\%} CI: 0.01, 0.05) and RD=-0.12 (95{\%} CI:-0.20,-0.04) among individuals with CVD. The adjusted total effect estimate demonstrates an increased number of deaths among obese individuals relative to nonobese counterparts, whereas the controlled direct effect shows a paradoxical decrease in morality among obese individuals with CVD. Conclusions: Sensitivity analysis demonstrates unmeasured confounding of the mediator-outcome relationship provides a sufficient explanation for the observed protective effect of obesity on mortality among individuals with CVD.},

@article{McCormick1985,
abstract = {The low-birth-weight infant remains at much higher risk of mortality than the infant with normal weight at birth. In the neonatal period, when most infant deaths occur, the proportion of low-birth-weight infants, especially those with very low weight, is the major determinant of the magnitude of the mortality rates. Furthermore, differences in low-birth-weight rates account for the higher neonatal mortality rates observed in some groups, particularly those characterized by socioeconomic disadvantages. Much of the recent decline in neonatal mortality can be attributed to increased survival among low-birth-weight infants, apparently as a result of hospital-based services. The application of these services is currently considered cost-effective, although whether this will continue to be true in the future is unclear because of the increased survival of very tiny infants. Although low-birth-weight infants remain at increased risk of both postneonatal mortality and morbidity in infancy and early childhood, the risk is substantially smaller than that of neonatal death. In addition, these adverse later outcomes have not offset the gains achieved in the neonatal period. Nonetheless, the increased survival of high-risk infants raises concern about their future requirements for special medical and educational services and about the stress on their families. Despite increased access to antenatal services, only moderate declines in the proportion of low-birth-weight infants has been observed, and almost no change has occurred in the proportion of those with very low weight at birth. In addition, in many areas of the country the birth-weight-specific neonatal mortality rates are similar for groups at high and low risk of neonatal death. In view of these findings, continuation of the current decline in neonatal mortality and reduction of the mortality differentials between high- and low-risk groups require the identification and more effective implementation of strategies for the prevention of low-weight births.},

abstract = {A probability distribution may have some properties that are stable under a structure (e.g., a causal graph) and other properties that are unstable. Stable properties are implied by the structure and thus will be shared by populations following the structure. In contrast, unstable properties correspond to special circumstances that are unlikely to be replicated across those populations. A probability distribution is faithful to the structure if all independencies in the distribution are logical consequences of the structure. We explore the distinction between confounding and noncollapsibility in relation to the concepts of faithfulness and stability. Simple collapsibility of an odds ratio over a risk factor is unstable and thus unlikely if the exposure affects the outcome, whether or not the risk factor is associated with exposure. For a binary exposure with no effect, collapsibility over a confounder also requires unfaithfulness. Nonetheless, if present, simple collapsibility of the odds ratio limits the degree of confounding by the covariate. Collapsibility of effect measures is stable if the covariate is independent of the outcome given exposure, but it is unstable if the covariate is an instrumental variable. Understanding stable and unstable properties of distributions under causal structures, and the distinction between stability and faithfulness, yields important insights into the correspondence between noncollapsibility and confounding.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI), body weight perception (BWP), and indicators of internalizing and externalizing distress and social, attention and thought problems in a large representative sample of Dutch youth. Methods: A total of 1826 pupils in the eighth grade of primary education and 5730 students in the first four years of secondary education gave their height and weight to obtain an estimate of their BMI. They reported their evaluation of their body weight and completed Achenbach's Youth Self-Report (YSR) (1991), which assesses eight types of problem behavior. Data were analyzed in a multivariate framework with BMI and BWP as predictors and the YSR scores on different kinds of problem behavior as dependent variables, controlling for background characteristics. Results: Both BMI and BWP are associated with internalizing and externalizing problem behavior, and social, attention and thought problems. Multivariate tests show that BWP is more closely linked to problem behavior than BMI. Adolescents who were either underweight or overweight but considered themselves in good shape had no more problems than the group with normal BMI and BWP 'good'. The perception of being 'too thin' and particularly the perception of being 'too heavy' best predict problem behavior in both male and female adolescents. Overweight youngsters with an adequate perception of their weight have less somatic complaints than their normal-weight peers who perceive themselves as too heavy, but they show higher withdrawnness, social problems, and anxiety/depression. Conclusions: Adolescent girls are more dissatisfied with their weight than boys; however, the relationship between weight perception and problem behavior is the same for both genders. ?? 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

"Multivariate tests show that BWP is more closely linked to problem behavior than BMI. Adolescents who were either underweight or overweight but considered themselves in good shape had no more problems than the group with normal BMI and BWP 'good'. The perception of being 'too thin' and particularly the perception of being 'too heavy' best predict problem behavior in both male and female adolescents."

 

"Overweight adolescents are socially marginalized (21)"

23 "found correlations between body esteem, social support, and several forms of psychopathology, including social phobia."

"A link has been established between body image dissatisfaction and depresssion (24, 25), anxiety (26, 27) and negative emotionality (28)."

Roth (3): 'body unintegrated' young people "scored highest on a general indicator or psychopathology and in particular showed higher scores on internalizing problems, i.e., depression, anxiety and attention deficit."

"Body image dissatisfaction has also been related to externalizing problem behavior. For instance, Jurich and Andrews (29) found juvenile delinquents to be more dissatisfied than their non-delinquent peers."

controlled for gender, age, household composition, family affluence, and social support from parents and from peers

BMI significant but weak predictor of problem behaviors

larger effect sizes for perceived weight

when both in the model, most BMI effects no longer significant

"Results revealed that both the groups that were either underweight or overweight, but evaluated their weight as good, had no more problems than the reference group of young people who had normal weight and felt good about it, thus stressing the importance of body perception."

"youngsters evaluating themselves as too heavy while having normal weight tended to have more somatic complaints; their truly overweight peers making the same evaluation reported more problems with social interaction and heightened anxiety/depression."

abstract = {METHODS: Various developmental problems including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been linked to biological deficiencies in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Additionally, there is evidence that symptoms may be reduced with PUFA supplementation. This study investigated effects of supplementation with PUFAs on symptoms typically associated with ADHD. Because nutrients work synergistically, additional effects of micronutrient supplementation were also investigated. A total of 132 Australian children aged 7 to 12 years with scores {\textgreater} or = 2 SD above the population average on the Conners ADHD Index participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention over 15 weeks, taking PUFAs alone, PUFAs + micronutrients, or placebo. Due to unreturned questionnaires, data were only available for 104 children. RESULTS: Significant medium to strong positive treatment effects were found on parent ratings of core ADHD symptoms, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, on the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) in both PUFA treatment groups compared with the placebo group; no additional effects were found with the micronutrients. After a one-way crossover to active supplements in all groups for a further 15 weeks, these results were replicated in the placebo group, and the treatment groups continued to show significant improvements on CPRS core symptoms. No significant effects were found on Conners Teacher Rating Scales. CONCLUSION: These results add to preliminary findings that ADHD-related problems with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity might respond to treatment with PUFAs and that improvements may continue with supplementation extending to 30 weeks.},

abstract = {Purpose: Inadequate prenatal care and higher incidences of higher-risk behaviors and gestational diabetes, in addition to other significant determinants of health, place aboriginal women at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among aboriginal women. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL for English-language studies reporting rates of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among aboriginal women. Data were extracted by three reviewers in duplicate. Study quality was assessed for biases in selection, exposure assessment, confounder adjustment, analyses, outcomes assessment, and attrition. Data were synthesized using random effect model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the country of origin of the aboriginal women. Results: Thirty-eight studies of low to moderate risk of biases were included. Adjustment for confounding factors was performed in eight studies. Unadjusted odds of low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), stillbirth, neonatal and perinatal mortality were increased among infants born to aboriginal women. However, adjusted odds were only increased for PTB and stillbirths. Subgroup analyses revealed higher unadjusted odds of LBW, PTB, stillbirth, and neonatal and perinatal mortality among Australian aboriginals; PTB, macrosomia, stillbirth and neonatal and perinatal mortality among Canadian aboriginals, and PTB and neonatal mortality among American Indians and Alaskan Native women. Conclusion: Aboriginal women are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes especially PTB; however, future studies assessing confounders adjusted estimates are needed. Differences in outcomes exist based on the country of origin of aboriginal women, reasons for which should be investigated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.},

abstract = {Endometriosis is a common gynecologic problem of unknown etiology. Estrogen dependence and immune modulation are established features of this disease, and environmental contaminants have been suggested to play a role in the pathobiology of this disease as well. Previous work in nonhuman primates has shown that exposure to the dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is associated with an increased prevalence and severity of endometriosis. Further animal experiments have implicated dioxin and dioxin-like compounds in this disease. Rodent studies support the plausibility of a role of environmental contaminants in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, although a convincing mechanistic hypothesis has yet to be advanced. Small hospital-based case-control studies have failed to provide compelling evidence for or against an association of environmental contaminants and endometriosis. Herein we review evidence that dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are potent modulators of immune and endocrine function critical to the pathobiology of endometriosis. Furthermore, perspectives on the potential mechanism(s) of dioxin and dioxin-like compound-induced toxicity in endometriosis, important knowledge needs, potential animal models for endometriosis studies, and considerations integral to future human case-control studies are discussed.},

abstract = {Research has shown that alcohol abuse is a significant problem among American Indians. It has been suggested, however, that American Indians and whites interpret the behavioral pattern differently, which may reflect the distinct symbolic-moral universes of the two groups. Whites are said to stereotypically blame Indians for the alcohol problem, and they favor assimilation to ameliorate it. American Indians purportedly blame the historical incursions of whites for the problem and advocate cultural revitalization to solve it. However, systematic empirical documentation of the competing viewpoints is lacking. Here we compare the perceptions of twelve American Indian and twelve white officials responsible for controlling alcohol abuse and related problems on the Wind River Indian Reservation, Wyoming. Data were collected using in-depth, semistructured interviews. The findings show that the two groups tend to converge in their assessments of the extent of the alcohol abuse problem but clearly diverge in their attributions concerning both its causes and appropriate approaches to controlling it. The discourse of whites and American Indians thus reflects the existence of separate symbolic-moral universes. This investigation redirects attention from the traditional focus on the incidence and etiology of alcohol abuse among American Indians to the politics surrounding the definition and interpretation of the deviant behavior. It also highlights the significance of cultural competition to race relations theories grounded in political economy, which are commonly used to analyze Indian-white contact.

"Alcohol use may stem from anomie due to blocked opportunities (ref), social disorganization from the breakdown of traditional cultural and familial relations (ref), and powerlessness and lowered esteem from economic deprivation (ref), and its use is a proximate factor that increases the likelihood of interpersonal violence as well as other behavioral problems."


"how the problem of Indian alcohol abuse is interpreted by American Indian and white officials charged with controlling the behavior."

"Indians have long recognized the deleterious effects of alcohol on their people. However, in contrast to the European view that emphasizes Indian degeneracy as the root problem, Indians blame the incursions of the dominant group... An indigenous theory of alcohol use indicates that rather than simply disinhibiting Indians, alcohol ruptured the communal and spiritual fabric of Indian life."

"The currently dominant medical-model approach to alcohol abuse is thought to be ineffective because its individualistic orientation fails to take the historical and cultural context of the behavioral pattern into adequate consideration. Contemporary clinical perspectives advocated by American Indian counselors diverge from that model, instead stressing holistic community intervention."

"widespread agreement about the seriousness of the alcohol problem... general agreement that alcohol abuse is a problem among both adults and juveniles... A majority in both groups identified child physical abuse/neglect and domestic violence as correlates of alcohol use."

white participants "were much more likely than the American Indian officials to point to alcohol-related sex offenses and sexual assaults" and other crimes

"The views expressed about the alcohol-crime link suggest that whites held beliefs more consistent with stereotypes that amplify the link between alcohol and criminality among American Indians"

drunken Indian stereotype

Ai officials more likely to attribute the alcohol problem to intergenerational transmission, lack of opportunity, poverty, outside culture, wheras white officials more likely to attribtue it to AI culture, individual-psychological causes

"perceptions of appropriate social control of alcohol problem" Ai more likely to cite cultural revitalization, white more likely to say assimilation or individual treatment off-reservation

"All of the American Indian respondents identified some type of community-based, on-reservation approach as the best strategy for controlling the reservation's problems with alcohol abuse. None of them suggested any type of off-reservation strategy."

"In contrast to the Indian participants, the white officials emphasized the need for assimilation into the larger society, which has long been a means used by whites in their attempts to control alcohol use among Indians."

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively review and evaluate the direct costs of endometriosis. DESIGN AND SETTING: We systematically reviewed studies published since 1990, and conducted an analysis of publicly available national databases (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey/National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey) in the United States. We assessed: [1] the overall economic impact of endometriosis; [2] the direct costs associated with specific treatments; and [3] the indirect costs of endometriosis associated with reduced work productivity. RESULTS: Of 13 published studies meeting inclusion criteria, 11 (85{\%}) addressed direct costs, a few studies addressed outpatient costs or indirect costs, and no study quantified the economic impact among adolescents. Direct endometriosis-related costs were considerable and appeared driven by hospitalizations. Our database analysis found: [1] as endometriosis-related hospital length of stay steadily declined from 1993 to 2002, per-patient cost increased 61{\%}; [2] adolescents (aged 10-17 years) had endometriosis-related hospitalizations; [3] approximately 50{\%} of {\textgreater}600,000 endometriosis-related ambulatory patient visits involved specialist care; and [4] females 23 years old or younger constituted {\textgreater}20{\%} of endometriosis-related outpatient visits. CONCLUSIONS: Health economic information for endometriosis is scarce, limiting our understanding of its overall economic impact. Nevertheless, the literature and other available data suggest that endometriosis places a considerable burden on patients and society.},

abstract = {Retrospective case-control studies are more susceptible to selection bias than other epidemiologic studies as by design they require that both cases and controls are representative of the same population. However, as cases and control recruitment processes are often different, it is not always obvious that the necessary exchangeability conditions hold. Selection bias typically arises when the selection criteria are associated with the risk factor under investigation. We develop a method which produces bias-adjusted estimates for the odds ratio. Our method hinges on 2 conditions. The first is that a variable that separates the risk factor from the selection criteria can be identified. This is termed the "bias breaking" variable. The second condition is that data can be found such that a bias-corrected estimate of the distribution of the bias breaking variable can be obtained. We show by means of a set of examples that such bias breaking variables are not uncommon in epidemiologic settings. We demonstrate using simulations that the estimates of the odds ratios produced by our method are consistently closer to the true odds ratio than standard odds ratio estimates using logistic regression. Further, by applying it to a case-control study, we show that our method can help to determine whether selection bias is present and thus confirm the validity of study conclusions when no evidence of selection bias can be found.},

There is a lack of data on recent trends in Canada. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study (n = 254,410) using the linked vital events registry databases for singleton births in Quebec 1996–2010. Aboriginal (First Nations, Inuit) births were identified by mother tongue, place of residence and Indian Registration System membership. Outcomes included preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age, large-for-gestational-age, low birth weight, high birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal death, postneonatal death, perinatal death and infant death. Results Perinatal and infant mortality rates were 1.47 and 1.80 times higher in First Nations (10.1 and 7.3 per 1000, respectively), and 2.37 and 4.46 times higher in Inuit (16.3 and 18.1 per 1000, respectively) relative to non-Aboriginal (6.9 and 4.1 per 1000, respectively) births (all p{\textless}0.001). Compared to non-Aboriginal births, preterm birth rates were persistently (1.7–1.8 times) higher in Inuit, large-for-gestational-age birth rates were persistently (2.7–3.0 times) higher in First Nations births over the study period. Between 1996–2000 and 2006–2010, as compared to non-Aboriginal infants, the relative risk disparities increased for infant mortality (from 4.10 to 5.19 times) in Inuit, and for postneonatal mortality in Inuit (from 6.97 to 12.33 times) or First Nations (from 3.76 to 4.25 times) infants. Adjusting for maternal characteristics (age, marital status, parity, education and rural vs. urban residence) attenuated the risk differences, but significantly elevated risks remained in both Inuit and First Nations births for the risks of perinatal mortality (1.70 and 1.28 times, respectively), infant mortality (3.66 and 1.47 times, respectively) and postneonatal mortality (6.01 and 2.28 times, respectively) in Inuit and First Nations infants (all p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions Aboriginal vs. non-Aboriginal disparities in adverse birth outcomes, perinatal and infant mortality are persistent or worsening over the recent decade in Quebec, strongly suggesting the needs for interventions to improve perinatal and infant health in Aboriginal populations, and for monitoring the trends in other regions in Canada.},

abstract = {Malaria is one of the most common and preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. In Africa, important progress has been made in the past decade with the introduction of a preventive strategy for malaria in pregnancy consisting of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated nets, yet their coverage is still unacceptably low and malaria continues to demand a huge toll on pregnant women and their newborn babies. Increasing the frequency of dosing of IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine might provide temporary respite, but increasing resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine makes research into safe, efficacious, and affordable alternatives for IPTp one of the  highest priorities for the control of malaria in pregnancy. A number of promising alternatives are, or will soon be, available that need to be evaluated as IPTp after their safety and pharmacokinetics in pregnancy have first been assessed in  parasitaemic women. Little is known about appropriate control strategies in Asia  and Latin America for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria in pregnancy, which in most countries rely on responsive case management approaches. The role of case management based on proactive screening for malaria infection of women attending antenatal care or preventive approaches with insecticide-treated  nets or IPTp are urgently needed. To achieve these objectives, multicentre and multidisciplinary approaches are required across the range of malaria transmission settings that include assessment of immunological effect of successful preventions, the perceptions and acceptability of different preventive approaches, and their cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The test-negative design (TND) to evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness is based on patients seeking care for acute respiratory infection, with those who test positive for influenza as cases and the test-negatives serving as controls. This design has not been validated for the inpatient setting where selection bias might be different from an outpatient setting. METHODS We derived mathematical expressions for vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations and used numerical simulations to verify theoretical results exploring expected biases under various scenarios. We explored meaningful interpretations of VE estimates from inpatient TND studies. RESULTS VE estimates from inpatient TND studies capture the vaccine-mediated protection of the source population against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations. If vaccination does not modify disease severity, these estimates are equivalent to VE against influenza virus infection. If chronic cardiopulmonary individuals are enrolled because of non-infectious exacerbation, biased VE estimates (too high) will result. If chronic cardiopulmonary disease status is adjusted for accurately, the VE estimates will be unbiased. If chronic cardiopulmonary illness cannot be adequately be characterized, excluding these individuals may provide unbiased VE estimates. CONCLUSIONS The inpatient TND offers logistic advantages and can provide valid estimates of influenza VE. If highly vaccinated patients with respiratory exacerbation of chronic cardiopulmonary conditions are eligible for study inclusion, biased VE estimates will result unless this group is well characterized and the analysis can adequately adjust for it. Otherwise, such groups of subjects should be excluded from the analysis.},

abstract = {A 5-year, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) primary prevention study was conducted in Washington State to: (1) assess the feasibility of using a FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic as a centre for identifying and targeting primary prevention intervention to high-risk women; (2) generate a comprehensive, lifetime profile of these women; (3) identify factors that have enhanced and/or hindered their ability to achieve abstinence. The results of this study are presented in two parts. Objective 1 is summarized in the preceding paper and objectives 2 and 3 are summarized here. Comprehensive interviews were conducted with 80 women, who had given birth to a child diagnosed with FAS, to document their sociodemographics, reproductive and family planning history, social and healthcare utilization patterns, adverse social experiences, social support network, alcohol use and treatment history, mental health, and intelligence quotient (IQ). These high-risk women were diverse in racial, educational and economic backgrounds, were often victims of abuse, and challenged by mental health issues. Despite their rather harsh psychosocial profile, many demonstrated the ability to overcome their alcohol dependence over time. Relative to the women who had not achieved abstinence, the women who had achieved abstinence had significantly higher IQs, higher household incomes, larger more satisfactory social support networks, were more likely to report a religious affiliation, and were more likely to be receiving mental health treatment for their mental health disorders. The rate of unintended pregnancies and alcohol-exposed pregnancies was substantial. Key barriers to achieving effective family planning were maternal alcohol and drug use, lack of access to birth control and lack of support by their partner to use birth control. A FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic can be used to identify women at high risk for producing children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Primary prevention programmes targeted to this population could lead to measurable reductions in the incidence of FAS.},

abstract = {Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models may be characterized in at least four different ways: via a factorization, the d-separation criterion, the moralization criterion, and the local Markov property. As pointed out by Robins (1986, 1999), Verma and Pearl (1990), and Tian and Pearl (2002b), marginals of DAG models also imply equality constraints that are not conditional independences. The well-known `Verma constraint' is an example. Constraints of this type were used for testing edges (Shpitser et al., 2009), and an efficient marginalization scheme via variable elimination (Shpitser et al., 2011). We show that equality constraints like the `Verma constraint' can be viewed as conditional independences in kernel objects obtained from joint distributions via a fixing operation that generalizes conditioning and marginalization. We use these constraints to define, via Markov properties and a factorization, a graphical model associated with acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs). We show that marginal distributions of DAG models lie in this model, prove that a characterization of these constraints given in (Tian and Pearl, 2002b) gives an alternative definition of the model, and finally show that the fixing operation we used to define the model can be used to give a particularly simple characterization of identifiable causal effects in hidden variable graphical causal models.},

abstract = {While the effects of low birth weight have long been explored, those of high birth weight have been essentially ignored. Economists have analyzed the negative effects that low birth weight might have on subsequent school outcomes, while taking into account unobserved characteristics that may be common to families with low birth weight babies and negative outcomes in terms of school test scores when children, in addition to labor market income when adults. Today, however, with increasing obesity rates in the United States, high birth weight has become a potential concern, and has been associated in the medical literature with an increased likelihood of becoming an overweight child, adolescent, and subsequently an obese adult. Overweight and obesity, in turn, are associated with a host of negative effects, including lower test scores in school and lower labor market prospects when adults. If studies only focus on low birth weight, they may underestimate the effects of ensuring that mothers receive adequate support during pregnancy. In this study we find that cognitive outcomes are adversely affected not only by low birth weight ({\textless}2500 grams) but also by high birth weight ({\textgreater}4500 grams). Our results have policy implications in terms of provision of support for pregnant women.},

"Control variables include family income, race/ethnic background, age, gender, height, weight, number of siblings, mother's body mass index (BMI) at the time the child was delivered, mother's age at the time of birth of child, mother's education, mother's age, whether the child was breastfed, gender, birth order, and region of residence."


cluster regressions by mother's ID

"In addition to these controls, we exploit the informaiton available on the mother during pregnancy and include the following variables as excluded instruments in our instrumental variables models: whether the mother used prenatal care, gestation, how much weight the mother gained during pregnancy, whether the mother was a teenager at the time the child was born, and whether the mother was over 30 years of age at the time the child was born."

instrumental variables regressions... "In particular, an increase in birth weight at 4500 grams of 100 grams decreases the average Piat math score by 0.682 and the average Piat reading recognition score by 1.395."

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between obesity and academic outcomes remains unclear. We evaluated the association between obesity and cognitive performance in US children. METHODS: We analyzed two nationally representative prospective cohorts of children in the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, ages 2 through 8 at baseline and followed for 6 years, from 1988 to 1994 (cohort 1, n=2672) and 1994 to 2000 (cohort 2, n=1991). The main exposure variable was obesity (defined as never obese, became obese, always obese, and became nonobese). The main outcomes were standardized scores on four cognitive assessments. Univariate regression analyses of test scores on obesity were performed. Fixed-effects regression models, controlling for measured and unmeasured time-invariant confounders, were additionally adjusted for time-variant confounders to analyze the impact of change in obesity status on change in test scores. RESULTS: Unadjusted analyses revealed a significant association between obesity and Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) scores. In cohort 1, always obese children had lower PIAT math scores than never obese children (beta=-7.48; p{\textless}0.05). Always obese boys had lower PIAT math scores than those who were never obese (beta=-16.45; p{\textless}0.01). In cohort 2, PIAT math scores were lower in the became obese category than the never obese category (beta=-4.10; p{\textless}0.05). Always obese girls had lower PIAT reading scores than those who were never obese (beta=-11.28; p{\textless}0.01). Fixed-effects models additionally adjusted for Home Observation Measurement of the Environment, Short Form score and height percentile showed no significant relationship between obesity and test scores in either cohort. CONCLUSION: Childhood obesity is unlikely to be causally related to cognitive performance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease characterized by the ectopic growth of endometrial tissue. In industrialized countries, it affects approximately 10{\%} of women of reproductive age. Its etiology is unclear, but a multifactorial origin is considered to be most plausible. Environmental organochlorinated persistent pollutants, in particular dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), have been hypothesized to play a role in the disease etiopathogenesis. However, results of studies carried out on humans are conflicting. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the exposure to organochlorinated persistent pollutants as a risk factor for endometriosis. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in Rome on 158 women comprising 80 cases and 78 controls. In all women, serum concentrations of selected non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs) and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs), 1,1-dichloro-2,2,-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-ethene (p,p'-DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were determined by ion-trap mass spectrometry. DR-CALUX bioassay was employed to assess the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalent (TEQ) concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and DL-PCBs. RESULTS: We found an increased risk of endometriosis for DL-PCB-118 [odds ratio (OR) = 3.79; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.61-8.91], NDL-PCB-138 (OR = 3.78; 95{\%} CI, 1.60-8.94), NDL-PCB-153 (OR = 4.88; 95{\%} CI, 2.01-11.0), NDL-PCB-170 (OR = 3.52; 95{\%} CI, 1.41-8.79), and the sum of DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs (OR = 5.63; 95{\%} CI, 2.25-14.10). No significant associations were observed with respect to HCB or to the sum of PCDDs, PCDFs, and DL-PCBs given as total TEQs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that an association exists between increased PCB and p,p'-DDE serum concentrations and the risk of endometriosis.},

The mediational g-formula was recently proposed to address this problem, paired with a semi-parametric estimation approach to evaluate longitudinal mediation effects empirically. In this paper, we develop a parametric estimation approach to the mediational g-formula, including a feasible algorithm implemented in a freely available SAS macro. In the Framingham Heart Study data, we apply this method to estimate the interventional analogues of natural direct and indirect effects of smoking behaviors sustained over a 10-year period on blood pressure when considering weight change as a time-varying mediator. Compared with not smoking, smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.2 (95 {\%} CI: -0.7, 2.7) mm-Hg. The direct effect was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.5 (95 {\%} CI: -0.3, 2.9) mm-Hg, and the indirect effect was -0.3 (95{\%} CI: -0.5, -0.1) mm-Hg, which is negative because smoking which is associated with lower weight is associated in turn with lower blood pressure. These results provide evidence that weight change in fact partially conceals the detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on blood pressure. Our work represents, to our knowledge, the first application of the parametric mediational g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the link between childhood overweight status and elementary school outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective study design: multivariate regression models examining the association between changes in overweight status and school outcomes between kindergarten entry and end of third grade, after controlling for various child, family and school characteristics. SUBJECTS: Nationally representative sample of US children who entered kindergarten in 1998, with longitudinal data on body mass index (BMI) and school outcomes at kindergarten entry and end of third grade. MEASUREMENTS: Wide range of elementary school outcomes collected in each wave including academic achievement (math and reading standardized test scores); teacher reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (BP), social skills (self-control, interpersonal skills) and approaches to learning; school absences; and grade repetition. Measurements of height and weight in each wave were used to compute BMI and indicators of overweight status based on CDC growth charts. A rich set of control variables capturing child, family, and school characteristics. RESULTS: Moving from not-overweight to overweight between kindergarten entry and end of third grade was significantly associated (P{\textless}0.05) with reductions in test scores, and teacher ratings of social-behavioral outcomes and approaches to learning among girls. However, this link was mostly absent among boys, with two exceptions - boys who became overweight had significantly fewer externalizing BPs (P{\textless}0.05), but more absences from school compared to boys who remained normal weight. Being always-overweight was associated with more internalizing BP among girls but fewer externalizing BPs among boys. CONCLUSION: Change in overweight status during the first 4 years in school is a significant risk factor for adverse school outcomes among girls but not boys. Girls who become overweight during the early school years and those who start school being overweight and remain that way may need to be monitored carefully.},

abstract = {Gastroschisis offers the intriguing epidemiological situation of a pandemic, strongly associated with very low maternal age. Identifying gastroschisis, and distinguishing it from the other abdominal wall defects, is theoretically easy but difficult in practice. The baseline birth prevalence of gastroschisis before the pandemic was approximately 1 in 50,000 births and has increased since between 10- and 20-fold. In many populations worldwide, it is still increasing. Such increasing prevalence and the association with very low maternal age are well proven, but the interaction between these two findings remains unknown. Geographic gradients (decreasing prevalence from North to South) are clear in Continental Europe and suggestive in Britain and Ireland. Gastroschisis seems more frequent in Caucasians compared to African Blacks and Orientals, and in Northern compared to Southern Europeans. These observations indicate the need for investigating gene–environment interactions. Since the global human situation is marked by inequalities among as well as within countries, the medical care and public health impact of gastroschisis varies widely among regions and social strata. The postnatal benefits of prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis include family awareness; adequate planning of delivery with alerted obstetrical, pediatric, and surgical staff; optimal risk categorization, and personalized protocol for action. The increasing prevalence of gastroschisis combined with improved medical techniques to reduce morbidity and mortality are also increasing the burden and costs of this anomaly on health systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {To: (a) extend previous research on the association between overweight status and depressive symptoms among adults to adolescents, (b) consider whether this association varies across social structural contexts and school context, and (c) explore additional mechanisms linking overweight status to depressive symptoms. We used survey regression procedures to analyze data from the first wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Degree of overweight was indicated by body mass index (BMI), which we calculated using self-reported height and weight information, whereas depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Data were analyzed to determine (a) the social groups in which being overweight was least common, (b) the association between overweight status and depressive symptoms, and (c) potential mediators of the association between relative weight and symptoms of depression, including dieting and self-rated health. The analytic sample contained 18,924 adolescents aged 11 to 21 years (mean age was 15.68). Approximately half the sample consisted of females (n = 9634). Adjusting for exercise and sociodemographic characteristics, we found that relative weight was associated with depressive symptoms for girls but not boys. For both, the association between overweight status and symptoms of depression was stronger among adolescents in lower grades. Dieting explained the positive association between relative weight and depressive symptoms for girls, whereas self-rated health mediated the association between relative weight and symptoms of depression for adolescents in lower grades. To fully understand both the physical and mental health consequences of adolescent obesity, the social dimension of weight must be examined. {\textcopyright} 2005 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

abstract = {Age is the main determinant of risk of endometriosis. The condition is rare before the menarche, probably increases with age until menopause and decreases after the menopause. The role of menstrual factors as determinants of endometriosis risk has been suggested, women with early menarche, short and heavy menstrual cycles being at higher risk. This has been generally explained by the reflux hypothesis. Parity is inversely associated with the risk of endometriosis, but it is difficult to define if nulliparity is a cause or a consequence of endometriosis. In some studies, the risk of the disease was lower among current oral contraceptive users, but higher in ex-users. However, these different findings may be due to selective mechanisms and indication bias. Other reported risk factors are family history of endometriosis, smoking, alcohol and coffee drinking, a diet rich in saturated fats, overweight (inverse relation), dioxin exposure, personal history of immune disorders.},

In this article we show that correct bootstrap estimates can be obtained by imitating the process of imputing the original data set in the bootstrap resampling; that is, by imputing the bootstrap data sets in exactly the same way that the original data set is imputed. The proposed bootstrap is asymptotically valid irrespective of the sampling design? the imputation method, or the type of statistic used in inference. This enables us to use a unified method in a variety of problems, and in fact this is the only method that works without any restriction on the sampling design, the imputation method, or the type of statistic},

"Implications for substance abuse prevention will be suggested, including interventions aimed at ameliorating the intergenerational transfer of HTR (which compounds the transfer of substance abuse across generations)."

"For the Lakota and Dakota/Nakota reservations, alcoholism mortality rates are almost 29 times higher than for the U.S. as a whole (AAIHS 1999)."

"Both prevention and treatment need to focus on ameliorating the HTR and fostering a reattachment to traditional Native values, which may serve as protective factors to limit or prevent both substance abuse and further transmission of trauma across generations... Improved relationships across generations may serve as protection against both substance abuse and the transfer of the HTR."

"The Lakota traditionally utilized no mood- or mind-altering substances."

"A Native culture that traditionally fosters extensive familial and social support networks also offers protection against substance abuse."

"Group trauma and psychoeducational interventions which seek to restore an attachment to traditional values manifest promising results for the Lakota (Brave Heart and DeBruyn In Press)."

Results indicate that deviant peer pressure and neighborhood problems partially mediate the relation between poverty and young adolescent antisocial behavior. The parenting practices and environmental influences that predict antisocial behavior do not vary by the child's gender or race/ethnicity, and vary little by the child's age. Findings suggest that when environmental risk is high, authoritarian parenting strategies result in lower levels of antisocial behavior.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have reported substantive correlations between indicators of parenting, children's emotion regulation (ER), and children's psychosocial adjustment. However, studies on underlying mechanisms are scarce. Particularly in early adolescence, it is still unclear whether relations between parenting and ER are caused by adolescent behavior, by parent behavior, or by reciprocal processes. Moreover, it is unclear whether ER can be seen as an antecedent or a consequence of psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this study was to examine predictive relations among parenting and adolescents' ER, and adolescents' ER and psychosocial adjustment, respectively. We collected longitudinal, multiple informant data at two measurement occasions (Grade 6, Grade 7). All told, 1,100 adolescents (10-14 years) and their parents filled out questionnaires assessing responsiveness and psychological control, adolescents' anger regulation, and adolescents' problem and prosocial behavior. Cross-lagged analyses revealed reciprocal effects between parenting, ER, and adjustment for the parent and boys', but not for the girls', report. Moreover, relations were different for adolescents with versus without clinically elevated symptoms of psychopathology. Our findings support the assumption that reciprocal relations between parenting, ER, and psychosocial adjustment are likely to persist until early adolescence. Nevertheless, the moderating role of gender and psychopathology should be taken into account. Possible reasons for the different findings, and practical implications, are discussed.},

'Child externalizing behavior was measured on the Externalizing Sclae of the BPI, a 28-item parent-report measure developed by Peterson and Zill (1986) and based on Achenback's Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach {\&} Edelbrock, 1985). The BPI contains six subscales derived through factor analysis(...) and trichotomous factor scales reflecting externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behaviors. Because the individual subscales have a small numer of items and lower reliability and we were interested in child behavior problems most strongly associated with marital status and maternal delinquent activities, the Externalizing Scale alone was analyzed (3).... Peterson and Zill (1986) report moderate alpha coefficients for the BPI subscales, ranging from .54 to .76"

abstract = {The mediation formula for the identification of natural (in)direct effects has facilitated mediation analyses that better respect the nature of the data, with greater consideration of the need for confounding control. The default assumptions on which it relies are strong, however. In particular, they are known to be violated when confounders of the mediator-outcome association are affected by the exposure. This complicates extensions of counterfactual-based mediation analysis to settings that involve repeatedly measured mediators, or multiple correlated mediators. VanderWeele, Vansteelandt, and Robins introduced so-called interventional (in)direct effects. These can be identified under much weaker conditions than natural (in)direct effects, but have the drawback of not adding up to the total effect. In this article, we adapt their proposal to achieve an exact decomposition of the total effect, and extend it to the multiple mediator setting. Interestingly, the proposed effects capture the path-specific effects of an exposure on an outcome that are mediated by distinct mediators, even when-as often-the structural dependence between the multiple mediators is unknown, for instance, when the direction of the causal effects between the mediators is unknown, or there may be unmeasured common causes of the mediators.},

abstract = {Objective This study investigated pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weight change in pregnancy as potential risk factors for intellectual disability (ID) in children. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting South Carolina, USA. Population A total of 78 675 mother-child pairs, insured by the South Carolina Medicaid programme, born in the period 2004-2007. Methods We analysed South Carolina Medicaid data, linked to data from both the South Carolina Department of Education (DOE) and the South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN). Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and weight change during pregnancy were obtained from birth certificates. ID cases were identified from the three sources listed above. We used generalised estimating equation logistic regression models to model the odds of ID in children. Main outcome measures Identified as having ID in special education, DDSN, or Medicaid billing records. Results The risk of ID was greater in children of women with pre-pregnancy obesity, and the risk was greatest in children born to women with morbid obesity (OR 1.52, 95{\%} CI 1.30-1.77 for ID of any severity; OR 1.73, 95{\%} CI 1.23-2.45 for severe ID). Gestational weight change (gain or loss) was not significantly associated with odds of ID. Conclusions Pre-pregnancy obesity may be a modifiable risk factor for ID in children, although further study is needed to evaluate whether the association meets criteria for causation.

abstract = {The Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its first identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most no-tably microcephaly and other serious brain anom-alies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse out-comes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists be-tween prenatal Zika virus infection and micro-cephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evi-dence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consis-tent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with pre-sumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infec-tion; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal rela-tionship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention ef-forts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the de-gree of relative and absolute risks of adverse out-comes among fetuses whose mothers were in-fected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of ad-verse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.},

@article{Bantje1988,
abstract = {Delivery records from hospitals in Ikwiriri and Ifakara show that the number of births increases throughout the dry season (June-October) and declines throughout the rainy season (November), reaching a peak just before the rains and the lowest level at the end of the rainy season. This pattern does not correspond with the usual explanations of birth seasonality. Conceptions are most frequent at the period of highest temperature, which is contrary to the theory that predicts them to be more frequent during the dry season. The drop of the conception rate during the wet agricultural season suggests that stress on women may be the main cause of birth seasonality in Tanzania. Due to wet conditions and frequent staying on in the rice fields, exposure to malaria increases during the rainy season's latter part. The negative association of the number of births with rainfall in the months preceding conception indicates that almost half of the variation in the number of births may be due to the effects of malaria and physical exhaustion on fecundity. The remainder may be    attributable to seasonal variations in pregnancy loss and sexual behavior. The absence of strong birth seasonality in nonholoendemic areas of Tanzania and the low birth rate in holoendemic areas provide further support for a critical role for malaria infection. The fact that the magnitude of seasonal variation in births increases with high parity and has decreased over the past decade results from recent changes in Tanzania's rural economy. Young people in Tanzania are progressively withdrawing from agriculture, especially when they have no children yet.},

abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, contributes to carcinogenesis through its role in the regulation of cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1)-catalyzed metabolism of carcinogens. Here, we investigated genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that affect AhR expression. Analyses of the human AHR proximal promoter in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells using luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed multiple specificity protein (Sp) 1 binding sequences that are transcriptional activators in vitro. The regulation of AhR expression was evaluated in long-term estrogen exposed (LTEE) MCF-7 cells, which showed increased AhR expression, enhanced CYP1 inducibility, and increased capacity to form DNA adducts when exposed to the dietary carcinogen, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine. The increased AhR expression in LTEE cells was found not to result from increased mRNA stability, differential RNA processing, or decreased DNA methylation. Analysis of the AHR proximal promoter region using chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that enhanced expression of AhR in LTEE cells involves changes in histone modifications, notably decreased trimethylation of histone 3, lysine 27. Upon further examination of the GC-rich Sp1-binding region, we confirmed that it contains a polymorphic (GGGGC) n repeat. In a population of newborns from New York State, the allele frequency of (GGGGC) n was n = 4 {\textgreater} 5 6, 2. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed the ability of sequences of this GC-rich region to form guanine-quadruplex structures in vitro. These studies revealed multiple levels at which AhR expression may be controlled, and offer additional insights into mechanisms regulating AhR expression that can ultimately impact carcinogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is a longstanding debate on whether such effects are relevant targets of inference in population health. In light of the repeated calls for a more pragmatic and consequential epidemiology, we review three issues often raised in this debate: (i) the use of composite cross-world counterfactuals and the need for cross-world independence assumptions; (ii) interventional vs non-interventional identifiability; and (iii) the interpretational ambiguity of natural direct and indirect effect estimates. We use potential outcomes notation and directed acyclic graphs to explain 'cross-world' assumptions, illustrate implications of this assumption via regression models and discuss ensuing issues of interpretation. We argue that the debate on the relevance of natural direct and indirect effects rests on whether one takes as a target of inference the mathematical object per se, or the change in the world that the mathematical object represents. We further note that public health questions may be better served by estimating controlled direct effects.},

abstract = {Large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies have transformed our understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited-either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e. a form of collider bias). Whereas it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.},

abstract = {Randomized trials are rarely representative of the general population. To account for this, results may be standardized to a target population which may be different from the one in which the trial was conducted. In this paper, we discuss three different approaches for reasoning about which covariates must be standardized over. This includes the traditional approach based on standard effect measures such as the risk difference or the risk ratio, Bareinboim and Pearl's graphical approach based on selection diagrams, and a new approach based on Counterfactual Outcome State Transition parameters. We compare and contrast these approaches, and argue that the choice must be informed by expert beliefs about which assumptions are most likely to be approximately true in the specific scientific context.},

These techniques include person-centered models that identify qualitatively different developmental pathways (cite) and growth curve analyses in which trajectories are defined in terms of individual and sample levels and changes in levels of behavior over time (cite)."
"Maternal sensitivity and responsiveness have been related to lower frequencies of child externalizing behavior in a number of studies."
"A second parental behavior predictive of more frequent externalizing behavior in children is harsh discipline."
"A third parental characteristic that has been related to externalizing behavior in children is maternal depression."
"In a meta-analysis of studies relating parenting to children's externalizing behavior, Rothbaum and Weisz (1994) found stronger associations between maternal behavior and externalizing behavior for boys than for girls, suggesting that boys may be particularly susceptible to the parenting they experience."
"single study investigating how trajectories of externalizing behavior are predicted by interactions among infant temperament, gender, and ethnicity, family demographics, and maternal sensitivity, harshness, and depression.... and to determine whether children who begin life at risk because they are boys or have more difficult temperaments are more -- or less -- affected by their mothers' sensitive behavior, harsh attitudes, or depressive symptoms and, as a result, exhibit more frequent externalizing behaviors over a longer period of time."
"multilevel modeling has the advantage of being able to estimate trajectories with some missingness on the outcome variable, and we were able to take advantage of this fact in the present analyses."
"Children may increase the frequency of externalizing behavior as a result of receiving less than optimal parenting from insensitive or depressed mothers, or more frequent externalizing behavior may lead to decreases in maternal sensitivity and the onset of maternal depression over time."
"For the purposes of these analyses, however, sensitivity and depression were lagged rather than being entered as simultaneous predictors in the previous analysis. This approach has been recommended by Singer and Willett as a method for examining reciprocal causation."
fewer externalizing behaviors as you get older
"Mothers consistently rated children as exhibiting more externalizing behaviors than did caregivers and teachers.... Mothers' and caregivers'/teachers' reports of children's externalizing behavior, moreover, were not highly correlated; at each time point, associations between the pairs of ratings were quite small."
"Only caregivers' and teachers' ratings reflected gender differences in the frequency of children's externalizing behavior"
"According to mothers' ratings, European American chidlren exhibited more frequent externalizing behavior than African American children, but this difference decreased with age from 2 years to 9 years; teachers, in contrast, reported that African American children displayed more frequent externalizing behaviors than European American children, and this difference increased with age from 2 years to 9 years."
"Maternal education, sensitivity, and harsh discipline were all significantly related to the frequency of children's externalizing behavior; children were more likely to exhibit externalizing behavior if there mothers were less educated, less sensitive, and harsher in their disciplinary attitudes."

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stimulation and nutrition delivered through health programmes at a large scale could potentially benefit more than 200 million young children worldwide who are not meeting their developmental potential. We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of the integration of interventions to enhance child development and growth outcomes in the Lady Health Worker (LHW) programme in Sindh, Pakistan.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We implemented a community-based cluster-randomised effectiveness trial through the LHW programme in rural Sindh, Pakistan, with a 2 × 2 factorial design. We randomly allocated 80 clusters (LHW catchments) of children to receive routine health and nutrition services (controls; n=368), nutrition education and multiple micronutrient powders (enhanced nutrition; n=364), responsive stimulation (responsive stimulation; n=383), or a combination of both enriched interventions (n=374). The allocation ratio was 1:20 (ie, 20 clusters per intervention group). The data collection team were masked to the allocated intervention. All children born in the study area between April, 2009, and March, 2010, were eligible for enrolment if they were up to 2{\textperiodcentered}5 months old without signs of severe impairments. Interventions were delivered by LHWs to families with children up to 24 months of age in routine monthly group sessions and home visits. The primary endpoints were child development at 12 and 24 months of age (assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition) and growth at 24 months of age. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT007159636.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: 1489 mother-infant dyads were enrolled into the study, of whom 1411 (93{\%}) were followed up until the children were 24 months old. Children who received responsive stimulation had significantly higher development scores on the cognitive, language, and motor scales at 12 and 24 months of age, and on the social-emotional scale at 12 months of age, than did those who did not receive the intervention. Children who received enhanced nutrition had significantly higher development scores on the cognitive, language, and social-emotional scales at 12 months of age than those who did not receive this intervention, but at 24 months of age only the language scores remained significantly higher. We did not record any additive benefits when responsive stimulation was combined with nutrition interventions. Responsive stimulation effect sizes (Cohen's d) were 0{\textperiodcentered}6 for cognition, 0{\textperiodcentered}7 for language, and 0{\textperiodcentered}5 for motor development at 24 months of age; these effect sizes were slightly smaller for the combined intervention group and were low to moderate for the enhanced nutrition intervention alone. Children exposed to enhanced nutrition had significantly better height-for-age Z scores at 6 months (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and 18 months (p=0{\textperiodcentered}02) than did children not exposed to enhanced nutrition. Longitudinal analysis showed a small benefit to linear growth from enrolment to 24 months (p=0{\textperiodcentered}026) in the children who received the enhanced nutrition intervention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: The responsive stimulation intervention can be delivered effectively by LHWs and positively affects development outcomes. The absence of a major effect of the enhanced nutrition intervention on growth shows the need for further analysis of mediating variables (eg, household food security status) that will help to optimise future nutrition implementation design.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: UNICEF.},

abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, independent risk factors for death commonly determine subsequent exposure to the study agent. For example, in occupational mortality studies, date of termination of employment is both a determinant of subsequent exposure to the chemical agent under study (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When a risk factor determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure can underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality, whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, "Which, if any, empirical population parameter can be causally interpreted as the true effect of exposure in observational mortality studies?" In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and estimation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers using our approach and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all cause and lung cancer mortality, which standard methods failed to detect. The analytic approach introduced in this paper may be necessary to control bias in any epidemiologic study in which there exists a risk factor which both determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure to the agent under study.},

abstract = {Scientific knowledge changes rapidly, but the concepts and methods of the conduct of research change more slowly. To stimulate discussion of outmoded thinking regarding the conduct of research, I list six misconceptions about research that persist long after their flaws have become apparent. The misconceptions are: 1) There is a hierarchy of study designs; randomized trials provide the greatest validity, followed by cohort studies, with case-control studies being least reliable. 2) An essential element for valid generalization is that the study subjects constitute a representative sample of a target population. 3) If a term that denotes the product of two factors in a regression model is not statistically significant, then there is no biologic interaction between those factors. 4) When categorizing a continuous variable, a reasonable scheme for choosing category cut-points is to use percentile-defined boundaries, such as quartiles or quintiles of the distribution. 5) One should always report P values or confidence intervals that have been adjusted for multiple comparisons. 6) Significance testing is useful and important for the interpretation of data. These misconceptions have been perpetuated in journals, classrooms and textbooks. They persist because they represent intellectual shortcuts that avoid more thoughtful approaches to research problems. I hope that calling attention to these misconceptions will spark the debates needed to shelve these outmoded ideas for good.},

Simulation studies on the influence of outliers by considering contaminated data under four perturbation patterns to generate outliers were carried out and confirm that the Beta rectangular regression model seems to be a new robust alternative for modeling proportion data and that the Beta regression model shows sensitivity to the estimation of regression coefficients, to the posterior distribution of all parameters and to the model comparison criteria considered.

A traditional way of estimating indirect effects is to use the "difference method," which is based on regression analysis in which one adds a possible mediator to the regression model and examines whether the coefficient for the exposure changes. The difference method has been criticized for lacking a causal interpretation when it is used with logistic regression. In this article, we use the counterfactual framework to define the natural indirect effect (NIE) and assess the relationship between the NIE and the difference method. We show that under appropriate assumptions, the difference method consistently estimates the NIE for continuous outcomes and is always conservative for binary outcomes. Thus, the difference method can be used to provide evidence for the presence of mediation but not for the absence of mediation.},

A total of 138 eligible women aged 20-45 were diagnosed laparoscopically and classified into three subgroups: control (no endometriosis), early endometriosis (stages I-II) and advanced endometriosis (stages III-IV). Neither CYP1A1 Ile462Val and CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphisms (genotypes with versus genotypes without the minor allele) nor serum dioxin and PCB toxic equivalency (TEQ) levels (low versus high) were independently associated with either early or advanced endometriosis risk. However, genotypes with the CYP1A1 462Val allele showed a statistically significant reduced risk of advanced endometriosis in combination with high serum dioxin TEQ levels (adjusted odds ratio = 0.13, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.02-0.76) (P for interaction = 0.08). Although no association was found between serum PCB TEQ level and advanced endometriosis in any stratum of CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism, a statistically significant interaction was found (P for interaction = 0.05). CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 polymorphisms may modify the relation between environmental exposure to organochlorine and advanced endometriosis risk.},

“Genetic factors were implicated in endometriosis by a large study in twins, which found that 51{\%} of the variance of susceptibility may be attributable to genetic influences (Treloar et al., 1999(. The effect of single genetic or environmental factors is usually weak; rather, multiple genetic and environmental factors collaboratively contribute to the phenotypic variation of endometriosis. Indeed, the analysis of gene-environment interactions in our present study identified synergistic effects between CYP gene polymorphisms and serum organochlorines, although genetic or environmental factors alone did not cause statistically significant differences in the risk of endometriosis.”

abstract = {Objective To study how many infertility patients would complete an average-sized family (achieve ≥2 live births) after a single, complete in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle. Design A retrospective cohort study. Setting University-affiliated private infertility practice. Patient(s) Women undergoing IVF. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) The outcome of 1 or ≥2 live births after a single retrieval cycle, followed by use of all embryos in subsequent frozen cycles in relation to oocyte number. Result(s) The pregnancy rate was statistically significantly higher when ≥15 oocytes were retrieved (289 of 699, 41.3{\%}) than {\textless}15 oocytes (518 of 1,419, 36.5{\%}). When investigating the outcome of ≥2 live births and assuming that all remaining frozen embryos were used, we found that 498 of 2,226 (22.4{\%}) patients would achieve ≥2 live births. We performed multivariate analysis, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 0.802. When controlling for multiple factors we found that as the number of oocytes retrieved increased, the chance of at least two live births increased, with odds ratio 1.08 (8{\%} live birth increase per additional oocyte). Conclusion(s) We demonstrate that one fresh cycle with high oocyte yield is an optimal way to plan IVF treatment. With modern cryopreservation methods, the concept of “one-and-done” could safely achieve ≥2 live births with just one stimulation cycle in almost a quarter of our patients.},

abstract = {Background The emergence of Zika virus in the Americas has coincided with increased reports of babies born with microcephaly. On Feb 1, 2016, WHO declared the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This association, however, has not been precisely quantified. Methods We retrospectively analysed data from a Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, which was the largest documented outbreak before that in the Americas. We used serological and surveillance data to estimate the probability of infection with Zika virus for each week of the epidemic and searched medical records to identify all cases of microcephaly from September, 2013, to July, 2015. Simple models were used to assess periods of risk in pregnancy when Zika virus might increase the risk of microcephaly and estimate the associated risk. Findings The Zika virus outbreak began in October, 2013, and ended in April, 2014, and 66{\%} (95{\%} CI 62-70) of the general population were infected. Of the eight microcephaly cases identified during the 23-month study period, seven (88{\%}) occurred in the 4-month period March 1 to July 10, 2014. The timing of these cases was best explained by a period of risk in the first trimester of pregnancy. In this model, the baseline prevalence of microcephaly was two cases (95{\%} CI 0-8) per 10000 neonates, and the risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection was 95 cases (34-191) per 10000 women infected in the first trimester. We could not rule out an increased risk of microcephaly from infection in other trimesters, but models that excluded the first trimester were not supported by the data. Interpretation Our findings provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of microcephaly in fetuses and neonates whose mothers are infected with Zika virus.

abstract = {Dioxin, a ubiquitous contaminant of industrial combustion processes including medical waste incineration, has been implicated in the etiology of endometriosis in animals. We sought to determine whether dioxin exposure is associated with endometriosis in humans. We conducted a population-based historical cohort study 20 years after the 1976 factory explosion in Seveso, Italy, which resulted in the highest known population exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-(italic)p(/italic)-dioxin (TCDD). Participants were 601 female residents of the Seveso area who were (3/4) 30 years old in 1976 and had adequate stored sera. Endometriosis disease status was defined by pelvic surgery, current transvaginal ultrasound, pelvic examination, and interview (for history of infertility and pelvic pain). "Cases" were women who had surgically confirmed disease or an ultrasound consistent with endometriosis. "Nondiseased" women had surgery with no evidence of endometriosis or no signs or symptoms. Other women had uncertain status. To assess TCDD exposure, individual levels of TCDD were measured in stored sera collected soon after the accident. We identified 19 women with endometriosis and 277 nondiseased women. The relative risk ratios (RRRs) for women with serum TCDD levels of 20.1-100 ppt and {\textgreater}100 ppt were 1.2 [90{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.3-4.5] and 2.1 (90{\%} CI = 0.5-8.0), respectively, relative to women with TCDD levels (3/4) 20 ppt. Tests for trend using the above exposure categories and continuous log TCDD were nonsignificant. In conclusion, we report a doubled, nonsignificant risk for endometriosis among women with serum TCDD levels of 100 ppt or higher, but no clear dose response. Unavoidable disease misclassification in a population-based study may have led to an underestimate of the true risk of endometriosis.},

"'Cases' were women who had surgically confirmed disease or an ultrasound consisten with endometriosis. 'Nondiseased' women had surgery with no evidence of endometriosis or no signs or symptoms."

"high frequences of endometriosis among infertile women living in Belgium, where breast milk concentrations of dioxin are among the highest in the world (7)."

large but nonsignificant odds ratios in other case control studies (17, 16)

no association in several others (18,19)

"We conducted a validation study in a clinic-based population in parallel with this study that indicated that symptoms or signs were not good predictors of disease, but that ultrasound had excellent specificity and sensitivity for ovarian endometriosis."

"A woman was considered uncertain for disease if she had no surgery and a negative ultrasound, but she had signs on exame and/or reported symptoms. In some statistical analyses, women with only signs or symptoms were considered nondiseased based on the validation study that suggested that only a small percentage of these women would have endometriosis at laparoscopy."

"We preferentially selected the earliest serum smaple available and sent the samples from Desio to the US CDC for TCDD analysis by high-resolution mass spectometry methods."

"Our study has some important limitations, the most notable of which were the limited power due to the small number of women with endometriosis and our inability to perform laparoscopy on every woman and thereby to determine definitively the disease status for the entire cohort.... This misclassification would lead to an underestimate of the risk, given that it is unlikely that there was differential disease misclassification.

"This study may have underestimated the effects of TCDD in that the group that was most heavily exposed, the youngest women, may have been underrepresented. For example, for cultural reasons we were unable to examine women who had never been sexually active.... younger women would have less of an opportunity for disease diagnosis."

"we found a doubled, non-significant, risk for endometriosis among women with serum TCDD levels of ≥100 ppt.... Finally, a more definitive study of endometriosis in the Seveso cohort should be conducted when a noninvasive biomarker for endometriosis is developed that can use the blood samples recently collected form this cohort."},

abstract = {Abstract: In perinatal epidemiology, birth outcomes such as small for gestational age (SGA) may not be observed for a pregnancy end- ing with a stillbirth. It is then said that SGA is truncated by stillbirth, which may give rise to survival bias when evaluating the effects on SGA of an exposure known also to influence the risk of a stillbirth. In this article, we consider the causal effects of maternal infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the risk of SGA, in a sample of pregnant women in Botswana. We hypothesize that previ- ously estimated effects of HIV on SGA may be understated because they fail to appropriately account for the over-representation of live births among HIV negative mothers, relative to HIV positive moth- ers. A simple yet novel regression-based approach is proposed to adjust effect estimates for survival bias for an outcome that is either continuous or binary. Under certain straightforward assumptions, the approach produces an estimate that may be interpreted as the survivor average causal effect of maternal HIV, which is, the aver- age effect of maternal HIV on SGA among births that would be live irrespective of maternal HIV status. The approach is particularly appealing, because it recovers an exposure effect which is robust to survival bias, even if the association between the risk of SGA and that of a stillbirth cannot be completely explained by adjusting for observed shared risk factors. The approach also gives a formal statistical test of the null hypothesis of no survival bias in the regres- sion framework.},

abstract = {Estimating the population risk of disease under hypothetical interventions--such as the population risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) were everyone to quit smoking and start exercising or to start exercising if diagnosed with diabetes--may not be possible using standard analytic techniques. The parametric g-formula, which appropriately adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula, and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the Nurses' Health Study. Over the period 1982-2002, the 20-year risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50{\%}. Under a joint intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet, moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the estimated risk was 1.89{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.46-2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nurses' Health Study data. This work represents the first large-scale application of the parametric g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study.},

abstract = {The effects of joint exposures (or exposure regimes) include those of adhering to assigned treatment versus placebo in a randomized controlled trial, duration of exposure in a cohort study, interactions between exposures, and direct effects of exposure, among others. Unlike the setting of a single point exposure (e.g., propensity score matching), there are few tools to describe confounding for joint exposures or how well a method resolves it. Investigators need tools that describe confounding in ways that are conceptually grounded and intuitive for those who read, review, and use applied research to guide policy. We revisit the implications of exchangeability conditions that hold in sequentially randomized trials, and the bias structure that motivates the use of g-methods, such as marginal structural models. From these, we develop covariate balance diagnostics for joint exposures that can (1) describe time-varying confounding, (2) assess whether covariates are predicted by prior exposures given their past, the indication for g-methods, and (3) describe residual confounding after inverse probability weighting. For each diagnostic, we present time-specific metrics that encompass a wide class of joint exposures, including regimes of multivariate time-varying exposures in censored data, with multivariate point exposures as a special case. We outline how to estimate these directly or with regression and how to average them over person-time. Using a simulated example, we show how these metrics can be presented graphically. This conceptually grounded framework can potentially aid the transparent design, analysis, and reporting of studies that examine joint exposures. We provide easy-to-use tools to implement it.},

abstract = {We discuss the implementation of a criterion due to Prentice for the statistical validation of intermediate endpoints for chronic disease. The criterion involves examining in a cohort or intervention study whether an exposure or intervention effect, adjusted for the intermediate endpoint, is reduced to zero. For example, to examine whether serum cholesterol level is an intermediate endpoint for coronary heart disease (CHD), we may investigate the effect of the cholesterol lowering drug cholestyramine on CHD incidence adjusted for serum cholesterol levels. We show that use of this criterion will usually demand some form of model selection. When the unadjusted exposure or treatment effect is less than four times its standard error, the analysis can usually lead only to a weak form of validation, a conclusion that the data are not inconsistent with the validation criterion. More significant unadjusted exposure effects offer the potential for stronger types of validation statement such as 'the intermediate endpoint explains at least 50 per cent (or 75 per cent) of the exposure effect'.},

abstract = {Although exposure to community violence and parental involvement have been previously found to independently predict aggressive behaviors, the interaction effect is less clear. Additionally, unique associations between exposure to community violence and reactive and proactive aggression, two widely-studied forms of aggression, in the context of parental involvement has yet to be examined. One population that may be of particular interest for such an investigation is immigrant adolescents, a population at increased risk of experiencing community violence and developing aggression. The current study therefore examined the joint and interactive contribution of community violence and parental involvement in the explanation of reactive and proactive forms of aggression among 81 immigrant adolescents (M age = 15.44). As expected, exposure to community violence was positively associated with both reactive and proactive aggression. Parental involvement, however, was not associated with either form of aggression. Further, the association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression was found to vary by level of parental involvement. Contrary to expectations, when levels of parental involvement were high, there was a positive association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression and no association when levels of parental involvement were low. Results have important implications for understanding unique developmental pathways and distinct correlates of reactive and proactive aggression among immigrant adolescents.

Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured at 7 years of age by Wechsler Intelligence Scales.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Maternal prepregnancy BMI displayed inverted U-shaped associations with child IQ after adjustment for maternal age, maternal education levels, maternal race, marital status, socioeconomic status, smoking during pregnancy, parity and study center. Women with BMI at around 20 kg/m2 appeared to have the highest offspring IQ scores. After controlling for familial factors in the siblings' sample, maternal obesity (BMI≥30.0 kg/m2) was associated with lower Full-scale IQ (adjusted {\ss}=-2.0, 95{\%} confidence interval -3.5 to -0.5), and Verbal scale IQ (adjusted {\ss}=-2.5, 95{\%} confidence interval -4.0 to -1.0), using BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 as the reference category.

"Compared to children born to normal-weight women who gained 21-25 lb. during pregnancy, those born to obese women who gained more than 40lb had 6.5 points deficit in IQ after adjustment for potential confounders"

"The applied linear regression models assuming a linear relationship between maternal BMI and neurodevelopment may have led to the inconsistent results."

10 -- GWG effect on fetal health

"To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigaed maternal weight in relation to neurodevelopment in offspring using prospective data considering the combination of prepregnancy BMI and GWG."

"The IQ scores wer classified into four groups: superior (IQ {\textgreater}- 120); average (IQ = 90-119); borderline (IQ = 70-79(; and intellectual disability (IQ {\textless}70)."

"Prepregnancy BMI at about 20 km.m{\^{}}2 was suggested as an inflection point for each IQ scale after adjustment of potential confounders"

"The correlation of maternal prepregnancy BMI with offspring's IQ was modified by GWG. Suboptimal weight gain, inadequate or excessive, was associated with an increased risk of low IQ score of the offspring at age 7 years in the women with normal weight. In the obese women, inadequate GWG was not associated with a decrease in IQ. Compared with children born to normal weight women who gained 21-25lb during pregnancy, those born to obese women who gained more than 40lb had a 6.5 deficit in IQ after adjustment for potential confounders."

"The above inconsisten results may be explained by several factors. First, linear regression models applied in most of these studies may obscure the actual nonlinear relationship between prepregnancy body mass and child cognitive development. Second, measures of child neurodevelopment or maternal prepregnancy BMI in some of the studies may be less than optimal."},

The program was designed to provide native communities throughout the United States with the knowledge, skills and strategies to initiate primary, secondary and tertiary prevention measures on their own. The key to the program was the training of a cadre of trainers/advocates in all local Native American and Alaska Native communities served by the Indian Health Service. These people were then supported and assisted in their efforts through a variety of means. Evaluation results of knowledge gained indicate that the local trainers had substantial success in imparting FAS information to a variety of audiences (prenatal groups, school children and community groups). Further, the evaluation samples also indicate that the knowledge was retained by the groups over time (2-4 months) and that there may have been some general diffusion of knowledge among peers in local communities. This program is presented in the hope that it will be replicated and improved upon by similar programs using this model as a base.},

mass public campaigns: "Unfortunately, those found least likely to change their opinions toward advocating abstinence when pregnant were younger, low socioeconomic persons who drank."

"In others, such as some Plains tribes, FAS risk is caused by a higher percentage of drinking women and a greater prevalence of abusive-drinking patterns in the overall tribal population."

abstract = {The Lese are subsistence farmers living in the Ituri Forest of north-east Za{\"{i}}re. They exhibit significant birth seasonality, with lowest frequencies of conception when food production is least, nutritional status is low and ovarian function, as measured by salivary steroid hormone levels, is reduced. Efe pygmy foragers, who live in the same geographical area but are less dependent on cultivated foods and have a more flexible life style, do not exhibit frequent fluctuations in nutritional status nor significant birth seasonality. These findings support a model of birth seasonality relating climatic variables to variation in fertility through a causal chain linking rainfall to food production to energy balance to ovarian function to fertility. The model, which emphasises an ecological approach to the study of human reproduction, should have broad applicability since seasonality of food production and energy balance is widespread geographically and across a wide variety of economies and cultures. Researchers compared 1980-87 data on rainfall, garden size, nutritional status, ovarian function, and births among the Lese subsistence farmers and the nomadic Efe pygmies who lived in the Ituri Forest in northeast Zaire to analyze the ecology of human birth seasonality. Natural fertility for the Lese was 2.35 and 2.56 for the Efe. Rainfall patterns determined the size of Lese gardens (p.05) which in turn determined nutritional status for both the Lese and the Efe (p.01), but particularly the Lese. Negative changes in female nutritional status diminished ovarian function. Specifically, women with lower indices of weight for height and who had lost 2 kg during the study had lower peak progesterone levels and ovulatory frequency than women who lost =or 2 kg. Menstrual cycles lengthened and duration of menstrual flow decreased with a decline in nutritional status. Conceptions were significantly reduced in May-July for the Lese (p=.012). For both Efe and Lese women, conceptions were lowest in May and highest in September. Lese women experienced considerably fewer conceptions during the periods with poor food availability than during other months (p=.002). The corresponding p value was almost significant for Efe women (.55). Thus Efe women experience less fluctuations in nutritional status than did Lese women, but variability in the seasonal pattern of rainfall did determine variation in fertility. The causal chain was rainfall - determined food production which determined energy balance which determined ovarian function which determined fertility. This model can be applied to any population in any geographic region. It integrates knowledge of behavior and cultural practices with the biology of human reproduction.},

@article{Kaufman2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic research is often devoted to etiologic investigation, and so techniques that may facilitate mechanistic inferences are attractive. Some of these techniques rely on rigid and/or unrealistic assumptions, making the biologic inferences tenuous. The methodology investigated here is effect decomposition: the contrast between effect measures estimated with and without adjustment for one or more variables hypothesized to lie on the pathway through which the exposure exerts its effect. This contrast is typically used to distinguish the exposure's indirect effect, through the specified intermediate variables, from its direct effect, transmitted via pathways that do not involve the specified intermediates. METHODS: We apply a causal framework based on latent potential response types to describe the limitations inherent in effect decomposition analysis. For simplicity, we assume three measured binary variables with monotonic effects and randomized exposure, and use difference contrasts as measures of causal effect. Previous authors showed that confounding between intermediate and the outcome threatens the validity of the decomposition strategy, even if exposure is randomized. We define exchangeability conditions for absence of confounding of causal effects of exposure and intermediate, and generate two example populations in which the no-confounding conditions are satisfied. In one population we impose an additional prohibition against unit-level interaction (synergism). We evaluate the performance of the decomposition strategy against true values of the causal effects, as defined by the proportions of latent potential response types in the two populations. RESULTS: We demonstrate that even when there is no confounding, partition of the total effect into direct and indirect effects is not reliably valid. Decomposition is valid only with the additional restriction that the population contain no units in which exposure and intermediate interact to cause the outcome. This restriction implies homogeneity of causal effects across strata of the intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable effect decomposition requires not only absence of confounding, but also absence of unit-level interaction and use of linear contrasts as measures of causal effect. Epidemiologists should be wary of etiologic inference based on adjusting for intermediates, especially when using ratio effect measures or when absence of interacting potential response types cannot be confidently asserted.},

abstract = {Unmeasured confounding may undermine the validity of causal inference with observational studies. Sensitivity analysis provides an attractive way to partially circumvent this issue by assessing the potential influence of unmeasured confounding on the causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity analysis approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as having a confounder that is binary, or having no interaction between the effects of the exposure and the confounder on the outcome, or having only one confounder. Without imposing any assumptions on the confounder or confounders, we derive a bounding factor and a sharp inequality such that the sensitivity analysis parameters must satisfy the inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to explain away the observed effect estimate or reduce it to a particular level. Our approach is easy to implement and involves only two sensitivity parameters. Surprisingly, our bounding factor, which makes no simplifying assumptions, is no more conservative than a number of previous sensitivity analysis techniques that do make assumptions. Our new bounding factor implies not only the traditional Cornfield conditions that both the relative risk of the exposure on the confounder and that of the confounder on the outcome must satisfy, but also a high threshold that the maximum of these relative risks must satisfy. Furthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed as a measure of the strength of confounding between the exposure and the outcome induced by a confounder.},

abstract = {Lower birth weight babies have worse outcomes, both short-run in terms of one-year mortality rates and longer run in terms of educational attainment and earnings. However, recent research has called into question whether birth weight itself is important or whether it simply reflects other hard-to-measure character-istics. By applying within twin techniques using an unusually rich dataset from Norway, we examine the effects of birth weight on both short-run and long-run outcomes for the same cohorts. We find that birth weight does matter; despite short-run twin fixed effects estimates that are much smaller than OLS estimates, the effects on longer-run outcomes such as adult height, IQ, earnings, and edu-cation are significant and similar in magnitude to OLS estimates.},

abstract = {Obtaining representative information from hidden and hard-to-reach populations is fundamental to describe the epidemiology of many sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Unfortunately, simple random sampling is impractical in these settings, as no registry of names exists from which to sample the population at random. However, complex sampling designs can be used, as members of these populations tend to congregate at known locations, which can be enumerated and sampled at random. For example, female sex workers may be found at brothels and street corners, whereas injection drug users often come together at shooting galleries. Despite the logistical appeal, complex sampling schemes lead to unequal probabilities of selection, and failure to account for this differential selection can result in biased estimates of population averages and relative risks. However, standard techniques to account for selection can lead to substantial losses in efficiency. Consequently, researchers implement a variety of strategies in an effort to balance validity and efficiency. Some researchers fully or partially account for the survey design, whereas others do nothing and treat the sample as a realization of the population of interest. We use directed acyclic graphs to show how certain survey sampling designs, combined with subject-matter considerations unique to individual exposure-outcome associations, can induce selection bias. Finally, we present a novel yet simple maximum likelihood approach for analyzing complex survey data; this approach optimizes statistical efficiency at no cost to validity. We use simulated data to illustrate this method and compare it with other analytic techniques.},

In principle, such a question offers no difficulty. One selects representative groups of persons having and not having the characteristic and determines the percentage in each group who have or develop the disease during this time period. This yields a true rate. The differente in the magnitudes of the rates for those possessing and lacking the characteristic indicates the strength of the association. If it were true, for example, that a very large percentage of cigarette smokers eventually contracted lung cancer, this would suggest the possibility that tobacco is a strong carcinogen.},

By contrast, although the difference in the allele frequency of the AHRR polymorphism did not reach a significant level, the genotype frequency was statistically significantly different between the two groups of men. Furthermore, the statistical difference became more significant when the frequency was compared between the Pro/Pro genotype and the Pro/Ala plus Ala/Ala genotype.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION(S): The Pro185Ala polymorphism in AHRR may constitute a susceptibility locus for dioxin-related male infertility. It appears that the negative feedback effect of AHRR on dioxin-related signaling is weaker for the proline allele than for the alanine allele, and that the hypomorphic function of the proline allele exerts a recessive adverse effect on male fertility.},

"For individual's susceptibility to dioxins, it is noteworthy that the biological effects of dioxins are mediated by several molecules including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) (7-10)."


 

"To date, two informative polymorphisms, Arg554Lys at exon 10 of AHR and Pro185Ala at exon 6 of AHRR, have been identified in the Japanese population, whereas no useful polymorphism has been detected for ARNT in the Japanese population, including the Asp511Asn and Asp517Glu at exon 16 identified in non-Japanese populations (11-13)."

 

used Taqman Minor Groove Binder (MGB) probes on the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System

"The results suggest that the Pro185Ala polymorphism in AHRR, rather than the Arg554Lys polymorphism in AHR, may be involved int he susceptibility to dioxin-related male infertility. Although the difference in allele frequency did not reach the level of statistical significance, the genotype frequency was statistically significantly different between infertile men and controls."},

Our findings offer several advances to the existing literature on the effects of early infant health on subsequent health, education, and labor force attachment. First, we use a large sample of both siblings and twins, second, we use a variety of measures of infant health, and finally, we track children through their schooling years and into the labor force. Our findings suggest that poor infant health predicts both mortality within one year, and mortality up to age 17. We also find that infant health is a strong predictor of educational and labor force outcomes. In particular, infant health is found to predict both high school completion and welfare takeup and length.},

They compared the AI health risks and health status with those of other persons (non-AI) living in Umatilla County, and assessed the progress of both AI and non-AI populations toward selected 1990 national health objectives. This AI population is likely to achieve the 1990 national health objective calling for less than 5 percent of births to be low birth weight (LBW); the LBW rate decreased from 5.0 percent in 1977-80 to 4.1 percent in 1984-86. However, the population is not likely to achieve the 1990 objective calling for at least 90 percent of women to begin prenatal care during the first trimester, even though the proportion of AI women who began prenatal care in the first trimester increased from 42.3 percent in 1973-76 to 62.6 percent in 1984-86. The Yellowhawk Indian Health Center began offering clinical services to AI in Umatilla County in 1976. Compared with non-AI women, AI women closed large gaps in key health risk and health status indicators during the period from 1973 to 1986. For example, from 1973 to 1976, 14.6 percent of AI mothers compared with 6.3 percent of non-AI mothers began prenatal care in the last trimester. By 1984 to 1986, only 9.0 percent of AI and 7.9 percent of non-AI mothers began prenatal care in the last trimester. Several other desirable health indicators improved more for AI than for non-AI from 1973 to 1986. These indicators included receiving at least one prenatal care visit during pregnancy, beginning prenatal care before the last trimester, and a larger proportion of mothers more than 18 years of age.Data from vital records can be used to monitor the health status of minority populations in small areas, such as counties. Clinic personnel serving minority groups can incorporate national and local health objectives into their strategy for improving community health.},

abstract = {Principled methods to appropriately analyze missing data have long existed; however, broad implementation of these methods remains challenging. In this and companion papers, we discuss issues of missing data in the epidemiologic literature. We provide details regarding missing data mechanisms and nomenclature and motivate principled analyses through a detailed comparison of multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting. We do so in the setting of a masked data-analytic challenge with missing data induced by known mechanisms to data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a multisite US study conducted from 1959 to 1974. We illustrate the deleterious effects of missing data with na{\"{i}}ve methods and show how principled methods can sometimes mitigate such effects. For example when data were missing at random, na{\"{i}}ve methods showed a spurious protective effect of smoking on spontaneous abortion, odds ratio (OR) of 0.43 (95{\%} confidence interval, CI=[0.19,0.93]) while implementing principled methods multiple imputation (OR=1.30, CI=[0.95,1.77]) or augmented inverse probability weighting (OR=1.40, CI=[1.00,1.97]) provided estimates closer to the “true” full data effect (OR=1.31, CI=[1.05,1.64]). We call for greater acknowledgement of and attention to missing data and for the broad use of principled missing data methods in epidemiologic research.},

abstract = {A recent study by Rier et al. showed that rhesus monkeys exposed daily for 4 years to 5 or 25 ppt of dioxin in food develop endometriosis, with incidence and severity related to dose. We aimed to determine whether the total time-integrated dioxin exposure of a human population could be comparable to that of Rier's monkeys. We selected a sample of residents of Seveso, Italy, who were acutely exposed to high levels of dioxin following an accident in 1976. We conducted a toxicokinetic analysis which takes into account species and exposure differences in dose and timing between humans and monkeys. The area under the time-concentration curve for dioxin in fat, which corresponds to cumulative exposure over time, ranges for some of the most heavily exposed Seveso residents from approximately 1.7 x 106 ppt-days to 1.1 x 108 ppt-days. These values exceed in all cases the values for the monkeys exposed to 25 ppt or 5 ppt. Given their exposure, the Seveso population should be an ideal epidemiologic cohort to rule out or confirm whether exposure to dioxin leads to an increased risk of endometriosis in humans},

"acutely exposed, via ingestion, inhalation, or dermal contact... A simple toxicokinetic analysis aimed at comparing monkey and human total exposure shows the potential for an increased risk of endometriosis for the Seveso population. Our toxicokinetic analysis takes into account species and exposure differences in dose and timing between humans and monkeys through modeling and use of species-specific parameters. The results are independent of the route of absorption differences because they are based on measured internal (blood or fat) concentration data."

"We assume that one-compartment kinetics apply for TCDD in monkeys and humans. Such an assumption is reasonable because TCDD is essentially stored in fat. Over time, the slow release from the fat compartment becomes the limiting factor of elimination from the body, and TCDD blood concentration at each time is proportional to the fat concentration."

"Mocarelli et al. (5) provide, for 19 Seveso subjects (males and females), the concentration of TCDD in blood (lipid adjusted) at time of last known exposure."

Here, it is shown that what is often taken as an indirect effect can in fact be further decomposed into a "pure" indirect effect and a mediated interactive effect, thus yielding a three-way decomposition of a total effect (direct, indirect, and interactive). This three-way decomposition applies to difference scales and also to additive ratio scales and additive hazard scales. Assumptions needed for the identification of each of these three effects are discussed and simple formulae are given for each when regression models allowing for interaction are used. The three-way decomposition is illustrated by examples from genetic and perinatal epidemiology, and discussion is given to what is gained over the traditional two-way decomposition into a direct and an indirect effect.},

abstract = {Despite a growing number of studies that have investigated the reproductive effects of maternal cocaine use, a homogeneous pattern of fetal effects has not been established and there is little consensus on the adverse effects of the drug. We used meta-analysis to evaluate the reproductive risks of cocaine. We reviewed the 45 scientific papers published in the English language dealing with effects of cocaine used during pregnancy on pregnancy outcome in humans, and identified 20 papers eligible for meta-analysis (cocaine use in pregnancy, pregnancy/fetal outcome studies, human studies, original work, cohort or case control studies, control group present, English language). Our analysis revealed that very few adverse reproductive effects could be shown to be significantly associated with cocaine use by polydrug users when compared to control groups of polydrug users not using cocaine [genitourinary malformations; odds ratio of 6.08 (95{\%} CI 1.18-31.3); gestation age: Cohen's d 0.37 (CI 0.2-0.55)]. When the control groups consisted of no drug users, the polydrug users abusing cocaine had a higher risk for spontaneous abortions [odds ration 10.50 (CI 11.74-64.1)]. Similarly, comparison of users of cocaine alone or no drug users revealed a higher risk for in utero death, in addition to genitourinary tract malformations. Analysis of continuous variables (head circumference, gestational age, birth weight and length) revealed that the effect size was dependent upon the nature of the comparison. Comparison of cocaine users to no drug users consistently yielded a medium effect size (Cohen's d) between 0.50 and 0.58, while comparison of polydrug/cocaine users to polydrug/no cocaine users provided effect sizes small to non existent (0.06-0.37). These discrepancies suggest that a variety of adverse reproductive effects commonly quoted to be associated with maternal use of cocaine may be caused by confounding factors clustering in cocaine users.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of maternal intelligence, and the effect of controlling for it and other important confounders, in the link between breast feeding and children's intelligence. DESIGN: Examination of the effect of breast feeding on cognitive ability and the impact of a range of potential confounders, in particular maternal IQ, within a national database. Additional analyses compared pairs of siblings from the sample who were and were not breast fed. The results are considered in the context of other studies that have also controlled for parental intelligence via meta-analysis. SETTING: 1979 US national longitudinal survey of youth. SUBJECTS: Data on 5475 children, the offspring of 3161 mothers in the longitudinal survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: IQ in children measured by Peabody individual achievement test. RESULTS: The mother's IQ was more highly predictive of breastfeeding status than were her race, education, age, poverty status, smoking, the home environment, or the child's birth weight or birth order. One standard deviation advantage in maternal IQ more than doubled the odds of breast feeding. Before adjustment, breast feeding was associated with an increase of around 4 points in mental ability. Adjustment for maternal intelligence accounted for most of this effect. When fully adjusted for a range of relevant confounders, the effect was small (0.52) and non-significant (95{\%} confidence interval -0.19 to 1.23). The results of the sibling comparisons and meta-analysis corroborated these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Breast feeding has little or no effect on intelligence in children. While breast feeding has many advantages for the child and mother, enhancement of the child's intelligence is unlikely to be among them.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to replicate and extend previous work showing an association between maternal pre-pregnancy adiposity and risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children. METHODS: A Swedish population-based prospective pregnancy-offspring cohort was followed up when children were 5 years old (N = 1,714). Mothers and kindergarten teachers rated children's ADHD symptoms, presence and duration of problems, and emotionality. Dichotomized outcomes examined difficulties of clinical relevance (top 15{\%} of the distribution). Analyses adjusted for pregnancy (maternal smoking, depressive symptoms, life events, education, age, family structure), birth outcomes (birth weight, gestational age, infant sex) and concurrent variables (family structure, maternal depressive symptoms, parental ADHD symptoms, and child overweight) in an attempt to rule out confounding. RESULTS: Maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity predicted high inattention symptom scores and obesity was associated with a two-fold increase in risk of difficulties with emotion intensity and emotion regulation according to teacher reports. Means of maternal ratings were unrelated to pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Presence and duration of problems were associated with both maternal over and underweight according to teachers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite discrepancies between maternal and teacher reports, these results provide further evidence that maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity are associated with child inattention symptoms and extend previous work by establishing a link between obesity and emotional difficulties. Maternal adiposity at the time of conception may be instrumental in programming child mental health, as prenatal brain development depends on maternal energy supply. Possible mechanisms include disturbed maternal metabolic function. If maternal pre-pregnancy obesity is a causal risk factor, the potential for prevention is great.},

"Many studies have reported differences between informants.

Researchers have grappled with this issue and concluded that a gold-standard might not exist and that differences stem from biases and actual differences in child behavior across environments (ref)"

differences by maternal ADHD status in maternal but not teacher ratings -- "suggests that rater bias is operating in the models using maternal report."

"overweight and obese pregnant women have increased concentrations of insulin, interleukin-6, and leptin and show that placental transfer of glucose is heightened in an animal model of obesity. Parallels can be drawn with studies of children prenatally exposed to high glucose levels due to maternal diabetes that find risk for neurobehavioral impairments (Ornoy, 2005)."

leptin resistance in the obese -- letin is associated with improved cognition -- pathway not straightforward

"Bodnar and colleagues (2007) show that pre-pregnancy obese women are likely to have difficulty synthesizing vitamin D due to the excessive adipose tissue that results in deficiency for both motehr and neonate; in turn, vitamin D is associated with neurocognitive function (EYles 2003).

abstract = {A meta-analysis was performed of the research published from 1985 to 1998 examining the effect of in utero exposure to cocaine on infant neurobehavioral outcome. The initial search for articles to include in the meta-analysis identified 18 studies with potentially meta-analytic variables. Of the studies originally retrieved, 13 failed to meet all of the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the meta-analysis. A total of 14 meta-analyses were performed comparing cocaine-exposed infants to nonexposed infants on NBAS cluster scales at birth and at 3-4 weeks of age. While the meta-analytic combination of studies produced a large enough sample size to drive statistical significance in a small majority of the tests of difference between the cocaine-exposed and nonexposed infants both at birth and soon after, the magnitude of all effects was small. The largest reliable differences appeared for the motor performance and abnormal reflexes clusters. Both also demonstrated a slight trend for increasing standard differences from birth to measures obtained at 3-4 weeks. The orientation and autonomic regulation clusters produced small, significant effects at both time periods, but the trend was for reduced effect sizes over time. All other effects appear truly negligible.},

abstract = {The optimal matching (OM) algorithm is widely used for sequence analysis in sociology. It has a natural interpretation for discrete-time sequences but is also widely used for life-history data, which are continuous in time. Life-history data are arguably better dealt with in terms of episodes rather than as strings of time-unit observations, and in this article, the author examines whether the OM algorithm is unsuitable for such sequences. A modified version of the algorithm is proposed, weighting OM's elementary operations inversely with episode length. In the general case, the modified algorithm produces pairwise distances much lower than the standard algorithm, the more the sequences are composed of long spells in the same state. However, where all the sequences in a data set consist of few long spells, and there is low variability in the number of spells, the modified algorithm generates an overall pattern of distances that is not very different from standard OM.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although surgery is currently the treatment of choice for managing endometriosis, recurrence poses a formidable challenge. To delay or to eliminate the recurrence is presently an unmet medical need in the management of endometriosis. To this end, proposals to investigate patterns of recurrence, to develop biomarkers for recurrence and to carry out biomarker-based intervention have been made. METHODS Publications pertaining to the recurrence of endometriosis and its related yet unaddressed issues were identified through MEDLINE. The reported recurrence rates, risk factors for recurrence, the effects of post-operative medication and causes of recurrence were reviewed and synthesized. In addition, several poorly explored issues such as time hazard function and mechanisms of recurrence were reviewed. Approaches to the development of biomarkers for recurrence and future intervention are discussed. RESULTS The reported recurrence rate was high, estimated as 21.5{\%} at 2 years and 40-50{\%} at 5 years. Few risk factors for recurrence have been consistently identified, and the evidence on the efficacy of the post-operative use of medication was scanty. The investigation on the patterns of recurrence may provide us with new insight into the possible mechanisms of recurrence and its control. The attempt to identify biomarkers for recurrence has started only very recently. CONCLUSIONS Much research is needed to better understand the patterns of recurrence and risk factors, and to develop biomarkers. One top priority is to develop biomarkers for recurrence, which may provide much needed clues to the possible mechanisms underlying recurrence and would allow the identification of patients with high recurrence risk, and permit for targeted intervention.},

abstract = {Wildcaught killifish from a contaminated site on the Elizabeth River (VA, USA) are refractory to induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A, measured as catalytic activity and immunodetectable CYP1A protein) after exposure to typical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists, as has been reported for fish from other sites highly contaminated with these compounds. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis for the lack of inducibility of CYP1A protein expression and activity in Elizabeth River killifish, we analyzed the expression of CYP1A and four other members of the AHR signal transduction pathway: AHR1, AHR2, AHR repressor (AHRR), and AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). Gene expression was measured by cycle-optimized reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) extracted from livers of killifish from the Elizabeth River and King's Creek (VA, USA) (reference site), 36 h after injection with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF, an AHR agonist) or corn oil (carrier control). Hepatic CYP1A mRNA was inducible in King's Creek killifish. However, in Elizabeth River killifish, no induction of CYP1A mRNA was observed, confirming and extending previous results showing no induction of CYP1A protein or catalytic activity in this population. Similarly, AHRR and AHR2 mRNA levels were induced by BNF in King's Creek but not Elizabeth River killifish. No population or treatment-related differences were observed in expression of AHR1 or ARNT mRNAs. The results reveal in Elizabeth River killifish a consistent lack of inducibility of genes that are normally inducible by AHR agonists (CYP1A. AHRR, AHR2). However, the expression of AHR1, AHR2, and AHRR in vehicle-treated fish did not differ between Elizabeth River and King's Creek killifish, suggesting that altered constitutive expression of AHRs or AHRR does not underlie the refractory CYP1A phenotype in Elizabeth River killifish.},

abstract = {Adolescence is an important developmental period for understanding alcohol use. American Indian youth are a group for whom various preventive interventions focusing on alcohol use have been implemented but have not necessarily been widely successful, highlighting the need to further refine our approaches. In the work reported here, we followed 464 14- to 18-year-old American Indian youth annually for seven years. We examined the development of alcohol use and positive alcohol outcome expectancies in parallel, using growth mixture modeling to identify classes with different trajectories of alcohol use and expectancies. We found five classes; the largest (n = 198) was made up of youth who experienced increases in both alcohol use and positive outcome expectancies. Initial levels of outcome expectancies were related to subsequent changes in alcohol use, while the reverse was not true, suggesting that interventions focusing on outcome expectancies are appropriate for a substantial number of youth. However, class heterogeneity in the relationships between the two processes pointed out that changes in expectancies may not always precede changes in alcohol use. Thus, intervention design implications are discussed for the class structures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a well-known cause of cardiovascular disease burden and premature death, but effects on depressive symptoms remain equivocal. Depressive symptoms may be more common among the obese individuals who perceive themselves as overweight, rather than those who perceive themselves as having an acceptable weight. Our aim was to determine whether weight status and weight perceptions are independently associated with psychological distress. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Australian National Health Survey 2004-2005 (N=17 253). All variables were collected by self-report. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to generate prevalence odds ratios with 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) for medium (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) scores of 20-29) and high (K10 scores of 30-50) psychological distress (compared with K10 scores of 10-19 as the reference) associated with weight status (standard body mass index (BMI) cutoffs for underweight, overweight and obesity vs normal weight), weight perception (perceived underweight and overweight vs acceptable weight) and weight misperception (incorrect with BMI vs correct with BMI) adjusting for numerous important covariates. RESULTS: Overweight and underweight perception increased the odds of medium (40 and 50{\%}) and high (50 and 120{\%}) psychological distress, whereas weight status and weight misperception were not associated with psychological distress in adjusted analysis. Gender, alcohol consumed per week and post-school education were not significant covariates (at P{\textless}0.10 level). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and underweight perception rather than weight status or weight misperception are significant risk factors associated with medium and high psychological distress prevalence and effects appear to be uniform for men and women. Well-designed prospective studies are still needed to determine whether weight perceptions cause psychological distress, and if so, whether symptoms are significantly reduced following effective intervention.},

The objective of this paper is to consider various analytic approaches for odds ratio estimation in this situation. One approach is to perform the usual matched-pairs analysis; the alternative is to combine pairs into strata and compute the conditional maximum likelihood or Mantel-Haenszel estimate. Matched-pairs analysis based on theoretic and simulation results may give misleading inferences, although on average it performs nearly as well as the stratified analysis. The occasional poor performance of the matched-pairs analysis results from the possibility of obtaining an extreme number of discordant pairs due to the random pairing within a stratum. It is concluded that the prudent policy is to perform a stratified rather than a paired analysis, even at the expense of additional computation.},

This paper treats a particular problem of generalizability, called “transportability”, defined as a license to transfer causal effects learned in experimental studies to a new population, in which only observational studies can be conducted. We introduce a formal representation called “selection diagrams” for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between populations of interest and, using this representation, we reduce questions of transportability to symbolic derivations in the do-calculus. This reduction yields graph-based procedures for deciding whether causal effects in the target population can be inferred from experimental findings in the study population. When the answer is affirmative, the procedures identify what experimental and observational findings need be obtained from the two populations, and how they can be combined to ensure bias-free transport.},

To address this problem, a diet and activity intervention during pregnancy, which was based on social learning theory, was initiated in 4 Cree communities. METHODS: A prospective intervention compared dietary, weight and glycemic indicators for 107 control subjects and for 112 women who received the intervention during the course of their pregnancy. A control period in 4 communities (July 1995-March 1996) was followed by an intervention period (April 1996-January 1997) when subjects were offered regular, individual diet counselling, physical activity sessions and other activities related to nutrition. RESULTS: The intervention and control groups did not differ at baseline regarding their mean age (24.3 years [SD 6.29] v. 23.8 years [SD 5.86]), mean prepregnancy weight (81.0 kg [SD 19.46] v. 78.9 kg [SD 17.54]) and mean gestational age at recruitment (17.1 weeks [SD 7.06] v. 18.5 weeks [SD 6.92]). The intervention did not result in differences in diet measured at 24-30 weeks' gestation, rate of weight gain over the second half of pregnancy (0.53 kg per week [SD 0.32] v. 0.53 kg per week [SD 0.27]) or plasma glucose level (50 g oral glucose screen) between 24 and 30 weeks (7.21 mmol/L [SD 2.09] v. 7.43 mmol/L [SD 2.10]). Mean birth weights were similar (3741 g [SD 523] v. 3686 g [SD 686]), as was maternal weight at 6 weeks post partum (88.1 kg [SD 16.8] v. 86.4 kg [SD 19.0]). The only changes in dietary intake were a reduction in caffeine (pregnancy) and an increase in folate (post partum). INTERPRETATION: This intervention had only a minor impact on diet; finding ways of encouraging appropriate body weight and activity levels remains a challenge.},

abstract = {It has been noted that there is ambiguity in the expression "attributable fraction," and epidemiologic literature has drawn a distinction between "excess fraction" and "etiologic fraction." These quantities do not necessarily approximate one another, and the etiologic fraction is not generally estimable without strong biologic assumptions. In previous studies, researchers have explained the relations between excess and etiologic fractions in the potential-outcome framework, and few authors have explained the relations between these concepts by showing the correspondence between the potential-outcome model and the sufficient-cause model. In this article, the authors thoroughly clarify the conceptual relations between excess, attributable, and etiologic fractions by explicating the correspondence between these 2 models. In so doing, the authors take into account the potential completion time of each sufficient cause, which contributes to further insight to clarify the 2 types of etiologic fraction, i.e., accelerating etiologic proportion and total etiologic proportion. These 2 measures cannot be distinguished in epidemiologic data, and the differences might be subtle. However, they are closely related to a very fundamental issue of causal inference, that is, how researchers define etiology. Further, the authors clarify the relation between 3 distinct assumptions-positive monotonicity, no preventive action (or sufficient-cause positive monotonicity), and no preventive sequence.},

We show that the resultant estimator is asymptotically normal with a simple variance estimator. One can construct confidence intervals for the proportion by using the direct normal approximation to the point estimator or by using Fieller's theorem. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods are appropriate for practical use. We provide applications to HIV/AIDS clinical trials.},

There are few easy-to-implement methods to correct for such bias. We describe and demonstrate how existing sensitivity analyses for unobserved confounding---propensity score calibration, Vanderweele and Arah's bias formulas, and Rosenbaum's sensitivity analysis---can be adapted to address this problem. In a simulation study, we examined the extent to which these sensitivity analyses can correct for several measurement error structures: classical, systematic differential, and heteroscedastic covariate measurement error. We then apply these approaches to address covariate measurement error in estimating the association between depression and weight gain in a cohort of adults in Baltimore City. We recommend the use of Vanderweele and Arah's bias formulas and propensity score calibration (assuming it is adapted appropriately for the measurement error structure), as both approaches perform well for a variety of propensity score estimators and measurement error structures.},

abstract = {Internalizing problems in preschool have been found to predict later anxiety and depressive disorders, and outcomes may vary according to children's gender. Preschool children's transitions to school pose additional risks, as this developmental period is associated with increased social and cognitive demands. Despite the significance of this age group and the long-term implications associated with early internalizing symptoms, most studies have focused on early behavior problems; relatively few have examined early precursors of internalizing disorders. One potential risk factor, particularly during the preschool-to-school age transition, is emotion dysregulation. Specifically, emotion overregulation, or excessive control of emotions, is ill-defined in current literature but may be associated with later internalizing outcomes. Therefore, in the present study, operational definitions of emotion overregulation were examined and clarified. Structural equation modeling analyses were also conducted to investigate both concurrent and longitudinal relationships between overregulation, negative parenting, and internalizing outcome variables. The potential roles of social context and gender in relationships with children's adjustment were also explored. Participants were 235 children (113 girls) at elevated risk for behavior problems. Children's emotion dysregulation was assessed using a multi-method approach: (1) laboratory-based behavioral task; (2) mothers' reports of children's emotion overregulation-related temperament; and (3) teachers' reports of children's emotion dysregulated behavior. Negative parenting behaviors were assessed via maternal parenting questionnaires. Mothers and teachers reported on child internalizing outcomes at ages 3, 6, and 10 years. Our analysis revealed several interesting pathways between predictor variables and internalizing outcomes. In particular, several emotion overregulation variables predicted internalizing behaviors concurrently and longitudinally, and negative parenting predicted internalizing behaviors across time. Shy temperament, negative parenting, and internalizing behaviors were also stable from preschool to kindergarten, and prediction models also suggested temporal stability of these variables from preschool to late school-age. As expected, some differences between mother- and teacher-reported outcomes were found, suggesting the importance of examining multiple contexts. Although gender was not a significant moderator in the proposed model relationships, unique gender-related findings were revealed. Results are discussed with respect to the value of multi-contextual, multi-level analyses of children's early emotion regulation abilities and parenting behaviors for prevention of internalizing behavior problems.

abstract = {Great care is taken in epidemiologic studies to ensure the internal validity of causal effect estimates; however, external validity has received considerably less attention. When the study sample is not a random sample of the target population, the sample average treatment effect, even if internally valid, cannot usually be expected to equal the average treatment effect in the target population. The utility of an effect estimate for planning purposes and decision making will depend on the degree of departure from the true causal effect in the target population due to problems with both internal and external validity. Herein, we review concepts from recent literature on generalizability, one facet of external validity, using the potential outcomes framework. Identification conditions sufficient for external validity closely parallel identification conditions for internal validity, namely: conditional exchangeability; positivity; the same distributions of the versions of treatment; no interference; and no measurement error. We also require correct model specification. Under these conditions, we discuss how a version of direct standardization (the g-formula, adjustment formula, or transport formula) or inverse probability weighting can be used to generalize a causal effect from a study sample to a well-defined target population, and demonstrate their application in an illustrative example.},

METHOD: Cross-sectional data from 16- to 18-year-olds who participated in the 1999 (n=9795) and 2001 (n=8190) Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System were used for this secondary analysis. RESULTS: No relationship was found between depressive symptoms and body mass index. However, perception of weight as either underweight or overweight was related to higher depressive symptoms. The risk profile for reporting depressive symptoms includes use of any weight control strategies, female, and perception of weight. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of addressing adolescents' perceptions of weight in relation to their actual body mass index and psychological well-being.},

Humans and animals are daily exposed to chemical pollutants that could adversely influence physiological processes and potentially cause diseases, including endometriosis. In this review, the authors aimed at settling the influence of environmental and dietary factors on endometriosis pathogenesis. The mechanism by which dioxin and its similes (TCDD/PCBs) act changing the endometrial physiology  remains uncertain and is speculative due to the difficulty in assessing the exposure over intrauterine life, childhood and adulthood and its actual consequences, in addition to the limitations to its in vitro reproducibility. We  need to better understand the mechanism of action of these environmental pollutants, not only on reproductive health, but also on overall health of individuals and so prevention strategies, including not only population education, but setting exposure limits, less polluting techniques and a better use of our natural resources, could be promoted.},

Genetic variation in AhR may modulate the susceptibility to dioxins. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -130 C/T in the AhR promoter on dioxin-inducible gene transcription, and to investigate interleukin-24 (IL-24) and interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) as proxies for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure. Using primary human chorionic stromal cells, we found that cells with the TT genotype showed higher AhR mRNA and protein levels than did those of the CC genotype. Microarray was carried out to analyze the gene expression profiles of cells (CC and TT genotype) after exposing the cells to TCDD. Several genes associated with human disorders were more highly up-regulated in cells of the TT genotype. Higher up-regulation of IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$ mRNA in cells with the TT genotype was observed. Furthermore, blood samples from 64 Yusho patients who were accidentally exposed to high concentrations of dioxins were analyzed for the genotype, dioxins concentrations and serum levels of IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$. We observed higher serum IL-24 levels and lower serum IL-1$\beta$ levels in Yusho patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype. AhR SNP -130 C/T affects serum IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$ levels, independently of serum dioxins concentrations in Yusho patients. Our observations demonstrate that SNP -130 C/T modulates AhR expression and expression levels of IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$, and suggest an association of AhR SNP -130 C/T with the susceptibility to dioxins.},

However, with increasing obesity rates in the United States, high birth weight has become a potential concern, and has been associated in the medical literature with an increased likelihood of becoming an overweight child, adolescent, and subsequently an obese adult. Overweight and obesity, in turn, are associated with a host of negative effects, including lower test scores in school and lower labor market prospects when adults. If studies only focus on low birth weight, they may underestimate the effects of ensuring that mothers receive adequate support during pregnancy. This study finds that cognitive outcomes are adversely affected not only by low birth weight ({\textless} 2,500 grams) but also by high birth weight ({\textgreater} 4,500 grams).

Methods: Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were analyzed. Logistic regression models examined the past-year likelihood for meeting diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders. Interactions between weight group and gender were utilized to determine whether associations were significantly different in men and women after adjusting for demographic characteristics. Results: First, consistent with previous NESARC analyses, the prevalence estimates of psychiatric disorders were higher among people of higher body mass index groups, regardless of gender. However, these patterns differed across genders. Both severely obese women and men, in comparison to normal weight respondents, were much more likely to meet criteria for affective and anxiety disorders, but these associations were significantly (1.5-2 times) stronger among women. For Axis II disorders, while there were very few associations between personality disorders and weight in men, among women increases in weight group were associated with increases in the likelihood of meeting criteria for a personality disorder. Conclusion: Weight and psychopathology appear more strongly associated in women than in men. While these data do not allow for identification of underlying mechanisms, they highlight the importance of assessing for psychopathology in overweight and obese patients, and suggest that weight management may be an important consideration in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. {\textcopyright} MBL Communications Inc.},

abstract = {Endometriosis is a puzzling disease with little known about its true prevalence, its distribution in the population, or its risk factors. It is thought to be a relatively common disease, however, with an estimated prevalence among women of reproductive age as high as 10{\%}.90 Given this relatively high prevalence and that women with the disease may have severe pelvic pain and infertility, endometriosis poses a significant public health problem. It is the third leading cause of gynecologic hospitalizations in the United States and a leading cause of hysterectomy.84 In a cost analysis prepared by the US Army, endometriosis cost {\$}2.6 million over a 6-year period for time lost to service because of surgical hospitalization alone.10 This is an underestimate of the cost in the general population because women generally are ineligible for active duty if they have severe symptomatic endometriosis, and time lost from work for unhospitalized sick days could not be accounted for. In a recent analysis45 of women who participated in the US Health Interview Survey, 50{\%} of those reporting having endometriosis had stayed in bed all day because of their condition at some time in the past 12 months, with the average number of bed days being 17.8. Thus, this disease is costly in its effects on women's quality of life, the expense of medical care, and its economic impact in the workplace. This article summarizes present knowledge about the epidemiology of endometriosis. In this article well-designed and well-controlled studies are emphasized.},

abstract = {Objectives: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are risk factors for health problems later in life. This study aims to assess the influence of ACEs on risky health behaviors among mothers-to-be and determine whether a dose response occurs between ACEs and risky behaviors. Methods: A prospective survey of women attending health centers was conducted at the first prenatal care visit, and at 3 and 11 months postpartum. Surveys obtained information on maternal sociodemographic and health characteristics, and 7 ACEs prior to age 16. Risky behaviors included smoking, alcohol use, marijuana use, and other illicit drug use during pregnancy. Results: Our sample (N = 1476) consisted of low-income (mean annual personal income, {\$}8272), young (mean age, 24 years), African American (71{\%}), single (75{\%}) women. Twenty-three percent of women reported smoking even after finding out they were pregnant, 7{\%} reported alcohol use, and 7{\%} reported illicit drug use during pregnancy. Nearly three fourths (72{\%}) had one or more ACEs. There was a higher prevalence of each risky behavior among those exposed to each ACE than among those unexposed. The exception was alcohol use during pregnancy, where there was not an increased risk among those exposed when compared with those unexposed to witnessing a shooting or having a guardian in trouble with the law or in jail. The adjusted odds ratio for each risky behavior was {\textgreater}2.5 for those with {\textgreater}3 ACEs when compared with those without. Conclusions: ACEs were associated with risky health behaviors reported by mothers-to-be. Greater efforts should target the prevention of ACEs to lower the risk for adverse health behaviors that have serious consequences for adults and their children.

abstract = {Epidemiologic studies are frequently susceptible to missing information. Omitting observations with missing variables remains a common strategy in epidemiologic studies, yet this simple approach can often severely bias parameter estimates of interest if the values are not missing completely at random. Even when missingness is completely random, complete case analysis can reduce efficiency of estimated parameters, because large amounts of available data are simply tossed out with the incomplete observations. Alternative methods to mitigate missing information, such as multiple imputation, are becoming an increasing popular strategy to retain all available information, reduce potential bias, and improve efficiency in parameter estimation. In this paper, we describe the theoretical underpinnings of multiple imputation, and we illustrate application of this method in a collaborative challenge to assess the performance of various techniques to dealing with missing data. We detail the steps necessary to perform multiple imputation on a subset of the Collaborative Perinatal Project, where the goal is to estimate the odds of spontaneous abortion associated with smoking during pregnancy.},

Yet little is known about the contemporary expectations, pressures, and norms that influence American Indian youth or how those might be shaped by today's lived cultural experiences, which frustrates attempts to mitigate the apparent disparity in sexual health. This paper used data from focus groups, in-depth interviews, and surveys with American Indian adolescents and young male and female adults from a Northern Plains tribe to contextualize sexual risk (and avoidance). Placing the findings within an adapted indigenist stress-coping framework, we found that youth faced intense pressures for early sex, often associated with substance use. Condoms were not associated with stigma, yet few seemed to value their importance for disease prevention. Youth encountered few economic or social recriminations for a teen birth. As such, cultural influences are important to American Indian sexual health and could be a key part of prevention strategies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Compared with natural conception, IVF is an effective form of fertility treatment associated with higher rates of obstetric complications and poorer neonatal outcomes. While some increased risk is intrinsic to the infertile population requiring treatment, the practice of multiple embryo transfer contributes to these complications and outcomes, especially concerning its role in higher order pregnancies. As a result, several jurisdictions (e.g. Sweden, Belgium, Turkey, and Quebec) have legally mandated elective single-embryo transfer (eSET) for young women. We accept that in very high-risk scenarios (e.g. past history of preterm delivery and poor maternal health), double-embryo transfer (DET) should be prohibited due to unacceptably high risks. However, we argue that mandating eSET for all young women can be considered an unacceptable breach of patient autonomy, especially since DET offers certain women financial and social advantages. We also show that mandated eSET is inconsistent with other practices (e.g. ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination–ovulation induction) that can expose women and their offspring to risks associated with multiple pregnancies. While defending the option of DET for certain women, some recommendations are offered regarding IVF practice (e.g. preimplantation genetic screening and better support of IVF and maternity leave) to incentivise patients to choose eSET.},

"maternal hyperglycemia only accounts for 25{\%} of the differences in birth weight in multivariate models (97, 120), which suggests that factors other than maternal-fetal glucose may be important"

"During pregnancy, maternal metabolism undergoes profound adjustments to meet the nutrient needs of the developing fetus. Early in gestation (the first and early second trimester), maternal insulin sensitivity can actually increase modestly (94), leading to increased maternal adipose tissue lipid storage. During this time period, pregnant women are in an anabolic state and accumulate fat as a result of enhanced lipogenesis and increased adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, which hydrolyzes circulating TG for tissue uptake (25, 94), resulting in a 3.5-6.0 kilogram increase in fat stores (71). Lean women increase their fat stores more than obese women per kilogram body weight, which is likely due to higher insulin sensitivity in early pregnancy, which promotes lipid uptake and de novo lipogenesis (25, 21)."

"Lipid metabolism differs greatly between lean and obese pregnant women. In lean women... net lipogenesis pregravid and in early pregnancy but net lipolysis in late gestation. In contrast, in obese women... lipogenesis occurs pregravid but less so in early pregnancy compared with lean women, with an earlier shift from the anabolic to catabolic state and a predominance of lipolysis (29). Additionally, a state of inflammation and hyperlipidemia may be present prior to pregnancy."

"recent data suggests that fetal-placental glucose and amino acid utilization rates are highest at 22-26 wk and decrease near term in contrast to lipid transport, which is maximal in the third trimester, coincident with rapid fetal fat accretion."

This paper discusses one aspect of this problem—the frequency distribution of birthweight. This distribution is essentially Gaussian but with additional births in the lower tail. It can therefore be divided into two components—a predominant (Gaussian) distribution and a residual distribution. The complete distribution can be summarized by three parameters: the mean and the standard deviation of the predominant distribution, and the proportion of births in the residual distribution. This paper shows that the predominant distribution is composed largely of term births, while the residual distribu- tion is composed almost entirely of small preterm births. It also shows that the three parameters together help to explain the apparent paradox that male infants suffer a higher perinatal mortality than females despite there being fewer light male births.},

Children completed measures of security and anxiety. Mothers and fathers' completed measures of violence perpetrated toward their partners and general hostility. Results of a Bayesian mediation model revealed indirect effects such that after controlling for other variables in the model, fathers' hostility was associated with greater emotional reactivity, which in turn was associated with children's reports of worrying. The indirect effects of mothers' hostility, parents' interparental violence, and child age on children's reports of worrying via children's emotional reactivity were not statistically significant. Results suggest that fathers' hostility is associated with children's reports of worrying among children residing with a substance-abusing parent via associations with children's emotional reactivity to parental conflict.

abstract = {The proportion of child deaths that occurs in the neonatal period (38{\%} in 2000) is increasing, and the Millennium Development Goal for child survival cannot be met without substantial reductions in neonatal mortality. Every year an estimated 4 million babies die in the first 4 weeks of life (the neonatal period). A similar number are stillborn, and 0.5 million mothers die from pregnancy-related causes. Three-quarters of neonatal deaths happen in the first week - the highest risk of death is on the first day of life. Almost all (99{\%}) neonatal deaths arise in low-income and middle-income countries, yet most epidemiological and other research focuses on the 1{\%} of deaths in rich countries. The highest numbers of neonatal deaths are in south-central Asian countries and the highest rates are generally in sub-Saharan Africa. The countries in these regions (with some exceptions) have made little progress in reducing such deaths in the past 10-15 years. Globally, the main direct causes of neonatal death are estimated to be preterm birth (28{\%}), severe infections (26{\%}), and asphyxia (23{\%}). Neonatal tetanus accounts for a smaller proportion of deaths (7{\%}), but is easily preventable. Low birthweight is an important indirect cause of death. Maternal complications in labour carry a high risk of neonatal death, and poverty is strongly associated with an increased risk. Preventing deaths in newborn babies has not been a focus of child survival or safe motherhood programmes. While we neglect these challenges, 450 newborn children die every hour, mainly from preventable causes, which is unconscionable in the 21st century.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of obesity during pregnancy raises concerns over the intergenerational transmission of obesity and its potential to exacerbate the current obesity epidemic. The fetal origins hypothesis posits that the intrauterine environment might have lasting effects on children's outcomes. A large literature establishes that mother's pre- pregnancy obesity is correlated with obesity in her children. However, previous research is largely based on comparing individuals across families and hence cannot control for unobservable factors associated with both maternal and child obesity. We use both within- family comparisons and an instrumental variable approach on a sample of 4435 children to identify the effect of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity on obesity in preschool-aged children. Consistent with extant research, OLS models that rely on across-family comparisons indicate a significant correlation between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and preschool obesity. However, maternal fixed effects render those associations insignificant. Instrumenting for mother's BMI with her sisters' BMI values confirms the null result indicating that the in utero transmission of obesity is likely not driving the increase in childhood obesity.},

"The user is reminded that, from an analytical perspective, combining raw scores for children at different ages is generally inappropriate. The user can consider several options in order to resolve this problem. First, she/he might consider developing age-normed standard or percentile scores using the NLSY child sample itself as the "normed" population"


"Much of the following material describing this assessment was provided by Zill in a Child Trends memorandum dated November 25, 1985."

"Zill and his associates at Child Trends performed comprehensive factor analysis procedures on teh 1981 NCHS data in defining the most appropriate items for inclusion in the overall scale and the various subscales. Principal components analyses were used by Child Trends to verify that the items in teh scale could be considered to be tapping common underlying dimensions. Using the binary scoring of items described above, major first facotrs were found for both children aged four through eleven and adolescents aged twelve thorugh seventeen. As anticipated, however, several secondary factors with eigenvalues greater than one were also obtained. FOr the children aged four through elvel, the first factor accounted for 25 percent of the total variance and 57 percent of the common variance. All but one of the scale items loaded on the first factor at a level of .38 or more..... The internal consistency reliability of the index scores was found to be alpha of .89 for the children and alpha of .91 for the adolescents."

"Although the Behavior Problems items in the CHild Health Supplement questionnaire are used to derive a single summary score, the scale was also designed to contain several distinctclusters of items, representing some of the more common syndromes of problem behavior found in children and adolescents. (Table 5.8.1)... Subscale scores were produced by dichotomizing responses to individual behavior items as above and summing across subsets of between three and six items. Principal components analysis with varimax rotation was used to verify, first, that the overal Behavior scale did contain several separable dimensions similar to those that were hypothesized to occur; and, second, that the groups of items used to compute subscale scores did hang together as anticipated."

Hence, the use of US norms to assess the development of children from other cultures may not be appropriate; 







There were no differences in the cognitive, fine motor and gross motor scales of Bayley III between 6 month old Sri Lankan (SL) and US children (Table 3) 









The test-retest interval ranged from 5 to 17 days, with a mean test-retest interval of 12.6 days. The intra class correlation (1, 1) coefficients for the cognitive, fine-motor and gross-motor scales were 0.897, 0.914 and 0.905, respectively.

Setting and Patient(s): Twenty-three studies comparing serum CA-125 levels and laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. Intervention(s): Serum CA-125 measurement and laparoscopy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Sensitivity and specificity of serum CA-125 measurement in the diagnosis of endometriosis with laparoscopy as the reference standard. Result(s): The estimated summary receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the performance of serum CA-125 measurement in the diagnosis of endometriosis grade I/IV is limited, whereas its performance in the diagnosis of endometriosis grade HI/IV is better. Conclusion(s): Despite its limited diagnostic performance, we believe that the routine use of serum CA-125 measurement in patients with infertility might be justified. In contrast to laparoscopy, serum CA-125 measurement is an inexpensive test that is not a burden for the patient. It could identify a subgroup of patients who are more likely to benefit from early laparoscopy. Studies reporting on the mutual dependence between serum CA-125 measurement and data from the history and physical examination are needed.},

Low birth weight also appears to be related to higher risks of several im- portant chronic conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, non-insulin- dependent diabetes, and cancer in adults. Thus factors that influence in utero growth and birth weight may have a serious effect on health outcomes many years later in life. Analysis of seasonal variations in birth weights may en- able us to suggest specific factors that influence this measure. In this review we summarize the literature on seasonal variations in birth weight. Although causes of seasonal variation in developing regions are more clearly under- stood, it is not yet clear which factors affect apparent seasonal variation in birth weight in developed countries. In our analysis we observed a pattern of seasonal variations in developed countries that differed between low-, middle-, and high-latitude countries, and we suggest several mechanisms that may be responsible for this diversity. Namely, we suggest that in middle- latitude climates, the large annual temperature range may cause low birth weights during summer, whereas in high- and low-latitude regions variations in sunlight exposure between seasons may contribute to low birth weights apparent during winter. Identification of the suggested causal environmental factors may have public health implications in the development of primary prevention programs for low birth weight and macrosomia in developed countries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test for a suspected adverse effect of low birth weight ({\textless} or = 2500 g) on IQ at age 6 years in two socioeconomically disparate populations. DESIGN: Nonconcurrent prospective study. SETTING: An urban, predominantly disadvantaged population and a suburban middle-class population in southeastern Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Low-birth-weight (N = 473) and normal-birth-weight (N = 350) subjects, randomly selected from the 1983 through the 1985 newborn lists of two major hospitals, one serving an urban and the other a suburban population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised to measure IQ. RESULTS: The mean full-scale IQ of low-birth-weight children was 4.9 points lower than that of normal-birth-weight children, controlling for population site, maternal IQ, maternal education, and race (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 6.8). There was no evidence of low-birth-weight interaction with population site, and the same IQ difference was detected in both populations. In the urban population, low birth weight was associated with an increased risk for IQ below 85 (odds ratio, 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 3.7). In the suburban population, low birth weight was associated with an increased risk for IQ below 100 (odds ratio, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.2 to 3.4). A gradient relationship with full-scale IQ was observed, with the largest deficit in those born weighing 1500 g or less, an intermediate deficit in those born weighing 1501 through 2000 g, and the least pronounced deficit in those born weighing 2001 through 2500 g. CONCLUSIONS: The overall effect of low birth weight represents an increase of approximately 10{\%} of low-birth-weight children with an IQ of more than 1 SD below the population's mean. Children born weighing 2000 g or less bore the major burden of the IQ deficits},

abstract = {High birth weight ({\textgreater}4.0 kg) has been associated with a wide range of health problems later in life. The interpretation of these statistical associations may be difficult, however. These difficulties are closely linked to methodological challenges in this research, such as filtering out confounding from family factors, disentangling associations with prenatal processes from associations with postnatal processes, and uncovering what birth weight actually represents. The well-conducted study by Kristensen et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2014;180(9):876-884), presented in this issue of the Journal, offers an interesting example of how one can filter out confounding from family factors. In an elegant series of analyses, the authors show how an apparent inverse association between birth weight and later intelligence among those in the highest range of the birth weight scale became a positive association when proper adjustment for family factors was made. Sibling comparisons were important here.},

abstract = {Background: Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) occurs in many occupational settings. There is evidence in animal models that maternal exposure to PAHs during pregnancy is associated with gastroschisis in offspring; however, to our knowledge, no human studies examining this association have been conducted., Objective: Our goal was to conduct a case–control study assessing the association between estimated maternal occupational exposure to PAHs and gastroschisis in offspring., Methods: Data from gastroschisis cases and control infants were obtained from the population-based National Birth Defects Prevention Study for the period 1997–2002. Exposure to PAHs was assigned by industrial hygienist consensus, based on self-reported maternal occupational histories from 1 month before conception through the third month of pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between estimated occupational PAH exposure and gastroschisis among children whose mothers were employed for at least 1 month during the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy., Results: The prevalence of estimated occupational PAH exposure was 9.0{\%} in case mothers (27 of 299) and 3.6{\%} in control mothers (107 of 2,993). Logistic regression analyses indicated a significant association between occupational PAHs and gastroschisis among mothers ≥ 20 years of age [odds ratio (OR) = 2.53; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 5.04] after adjusting for maternal body mass index, education, gestational diabetes, and smoking. This association was not seen in mothers {\textless} 20 years (OR = 1.14; 95{\%} CI: 0.55, 2.33), which is notable because although young maternal age is the strongest known risk factor for gastroschisis, most cases are born to mothers ≥ 20 years., Conclusion: Our findings indicate an association between occupational exposure to PAHs among mothers who are ≥ 20 years and gastroschisis. These results contribute to a body of evidence that PAHs may be teratogenic.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adverse effects of obesity have been linked to inflammation in various tissues, but studies on placental inflammation and obesity have demonstrated conflicting findings. We sought to investigate the influence of pregravid obesity and fetal sex on placental histopathology while controlling for diabetes and hypertension. METHODS: Placental histopathology focusing on inflammatory markers of a cohort of normal weight (BMI = 20-24.9) and obese (BMI ≥ 30) patients was characterized. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal variables were assessed. RESULTS: 192 normal and 231 obese women were included. Placental characteristics associated with obesity and fetal sex independent of diabetes and hypertension were placental disc weight {\textgreater}90(th) percentile, decreased placental efficiency, chronic villitis (CV), fetal thrombosis, and normoblastemia. Additionally, female fetuses of obese mothers had higher rates of CV and fetal thrombosis. Increasing BMI increased the risk of normoblastemia and CV. The final grade and extent of CV was significantly associated with obesity and BMI, but not fetal gender. Finally, CV was less common in large-for-gestation placentas. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity results in placental overgrowth and fetal hypoxia as manifested by normoblastemia; it is also associated with an increased incidence of CV and fetal thrombosis, both more prevalent in female placentas. We have shown for the first time that the effect of maternal obesity on placental inflammation is independent of diabetes and hypertension, but significantly affected by fetal sex. Our data also point to the intriguing possibility that CV serves to normalize placental size, and potentially fetal growth, in the setting of maternal obesity.},

Methods. 1998 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth interview data for 8- to 11-year-old children and their mothers were analyzed. A Behavior Problems Index score {\textgreater}90th percentile was considered clinically meaningful. Child overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater}95th percentile for age and sex. Multiple logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders (selected a priori): child's sex, race, use of behavior-modifying medication, history of academic retention, and hours of television per day; maternal obesity, smoking status, marital status, education, and depressive symptoms; family poverty status; and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form (HOME-SF) cognitive stimulation score. In an attempt to elucidate temporal sequence, a second analysis was conducted with a subsample of normal-weight children who became overweight between 1996 and 1998 while controlling for BMI z score in 1996. Results. The sample included 755 mother-child pairs. Of the potential confounding Variables, race, maternal obesity, academic grade retention, maternal education, poverty status, and HOME-SF cognitive stimulation score acted as joint confounders, altering the relationship between behavior problems and overweight in the multiple logistic regression model. With these covariates in the final model, behavior problems were independently associated with concurrent child overweight (adjusted odds ratio: 2.95; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.34-6.49). The relationship was strengthened in the subsample of previously normal-weight children, with race, maternal obesity, HOME-SF cognitive stimulation score, and 1996 BMI z score acting as confounders (adjusted odds ratio: 5.23; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.37-19.9).

"The BPI was created by Zill and Peterson (26) to measure the frequency, range, and type of childhood behavior problems for children ages 4 years and older. Many items were derived from the Achenback Child Behavior Checklist (27). Mothers could answer "often", "sometimes true", or "not true" to each item. Responses were dichotomized into "often or sometimes true" or "not true" bythe NLSY. Externalizing and Interalizing standardscores were created by the NLSY on the basis of the trichotomous "often", "sometimes true", or "not true" rating. Norms for externalizing and internalizing standard scores are age based but not sex based. Some questions in the BPI contribute to both the internalizing and the externalizing subscore. The BPI is also divided into 6 subscalse: antisocial, anxious/depressed, dependent, headstrong, hyperactive, and peer conflicts/withdrawn.The specific questions included in teh BPI are provided in Table 2... We categrized total BPI standard scores as clinicallymeaningful when they were {\textgreater}90th percentile for the entire cohort of 8-11 year old children n the NLSY in 1996 and in 1998. We selected this cutoff on the basis of previous data indicating that BPI scores at this level are associated with higher rates of referrals for mental health services (9). The {\textgreater}90th percentile cutoff was also used to categorize internalizing and externalizing standard scores as clinically meaningful."

abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

Weight Gain During Pregnancy responds to the need for a reexamination of the 1990 Institute of Medicine guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy. It builds on the conceptual framework that underscored the 1990 weight gain guidelines and addresses the need to update them through a comprehensive review of the literature and independent analyses of existing databases. The book explores relationships between weight gain during pregnancy and a variety of factors (e.g., the mother's weight and height before pregnancy) and places this in the context of the health of the infant and the mother, presenting specific, updated target ranges for weight gain during pregnancy and guidelines for proper measurement. New features of this book include a specific range of recommended gain for obese women. Weight Gain During Pregnancy is intended to assist practitioners who care for women of childbearing age, policy makers, educators, researchers, and the pregnant women themselves to understand the role of gestational weight gain and to provide them with the tools needed to promote optimal pregnancy outcomes"--P.

abstract = {Emotion regulation (ER) was assessed during a negative mood induction in 79 preschoolers who varied in degree of behavior problems. Facial expressivity during the induction was used to identify 3 ER groups: inexpressive, modulated expressive, and highly expressive. Group differences in ER were significantly related to heart rate and skin conductance. Inexpressive preschoolers had the highest heart rate, lowest vagal tone, and smallest autonomic nervous system (ANS) change during the induction. Highly expressive preschoolers had the slowest heart rate, highest vagal tone, and largest ANS change. The inexpressive and highly expressive groups had more externalizing symptoms than the modulated group at preschool age and at follow-up at the end of 1st grade. Inexpressive preschoolers appeared to have more depressed and anxious symptoms at follow-up.},

abstract = {The causal inference literature has provided definitions of direct and indirect effects based on counterfactuals that generalize the approach found in the social science literature. However, these definitions presuppose well-defined hypothetical interventions on the mediator. In many settings, there may be multiple ways to fix the mediator to a particular value, and these various hypothetical interventions may have very different implications for the outcome of interest. In this paper, we consider mediation analysis when multiple versions of the mediator are present. Specifically, we consider the problem of attempting to decompose a total effect of an exposure on an outcome into the portion through the intermediate and the portion through other pathways. We consider the setting in which there are multiple versions of the mediator but the investigator has access only to data on the particular measurement, not information on which version of the mediator may have brought that value about. We show that the quantity that is estimated as a natural indirect effect using only the available data does indeed have an interpretation as a particular type of mediated effect; however, the quantity estimated as a natural direct effect, in fact, captures both a true direct effect and an effect of the exposure on the outcome mediated through the effect of the version of the mediator that is not captured by the mediator measurement. The results are illustrated using 2 examples from the literature, one in which the versions of the mediator are unknown and another in which the mediator itself has been dichotomized.},

@article{Huber2009,
abstract = {Epidemiological studies on premodern and modern Western societies indicate that birth season may influence female reproduction. Nothing is known, however, about this effect in developing economies. Many of the latter are characterised by tropical climates with a rainy season associated with lower food availability and a greater prevalence of infectious diseases. We therefore predict that an association between birth month and reproductive output, if it exists, should be related to the rainy season. To test this prediction, we analysed census data of Vietnam obtained from IPUMS-International (Vietnam 1999 Population and Housing Census). Based on 493,853 women born between 1950 and 1977 and thus aged 22 to 49 years, we found that the time series of mean offspring count per month of birth has a highly significant period of 12 months (power = 46.871, P {\textless} 0.00001). Our results further indicate that the 12-month periodic signal has a maximum in July and a minimum in January. Accordingly, the peak corresponds to birth during the rainy season, the low if the third pregnancy month concurs with the rainy season. The month of birth is therefore clearly associated with the later reproductive performance of Vietnamese women, strongly supporting the assumption that environmental and maternal conditions during early development exert long-term effects on reproductive functioning. Provided the rainy season adversely affects developmental processes due to inadequate food and/or high infection risk, the association reported here points to a critical period of reproductive development during early pregnancy.},

abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies?},

abstract = {The design of occupational epidemiology studies should be based on the need to minimise random and systematic error. The latter is the focus of this paper, and includes selection bias, information bias and confounding. Selection bias can be minimised by obtaining a high response rate (and by appropriate selection of the control group in a case-control study). In general, it is important to ensure that information bias is minimised and is also non-differential (for example, that the misclassification of exposure is not related to disease status) by collecting data in a standardised manner. A major concern in occupational epidemiology studies usually relates to confounding, because exposure has not been randomly allocated, and the groups under study may therefore have different baseline disease risks. For each of these types of bias, the goal should be to avoid the bias by appropriate study design and/or appropriate control in the analysis. However, it is also important to attempt to assess the likely direction and strength of biases that cannot be avoided or controlled.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become increasingly complicated, and it is unknown whether poor outcomes (prolonged steroid use, hospitalizations, and surgery) have declined in the general population. Methods: This multilevel study used computerized clinical data. The study comprised 2892 adults with Crohn's disease (CD) and 5895 with ulcerative colitis (UC) who received care at 16 medical centers within an integrated care organization in Northern California between 1998 and 2005. Results: Time trends included (1) a shift in gastroenterology-related visits from the gastroenterology division to primary care; (2) increased use of IBD-related drugs, except for a 7{\%} decline in use of 5-aminosalicylate in CD and no change in steroid use for CD; (3) for the prevalence of prolonged steroid exposure (120 days of continuous use), a 36{\%} decline for CD with a 27{\%} increase for UC; (4) declines in the hospitalization rates of 33{\%} for CD and 29{\%} for UC; and (5) for the surgery rate, no significant change for CD with a 50{\%} decline for UC. Conclusions: Declines in prolonged steroid exposure and the hospitalization rate for CD and in the hospitalization and surgery rate for UC are encouraging; however, the increase in prolonged steroid exposure for UC merits concern and further investigation. The variability in care patterns observed in this study suggests lack of standardization of care and the opportunity to identify targets for quality improvement. These findings should stimulate research to quantify the effect of current trends in IBD management. {\textcopyright} 2009 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater epidemiologic understanding of the relationships among fetal-infant mortality and its prognostic factors, including birthweight, could have vast public health implications. A key step toward that understanding is a realistic and tractable framework for analyzing birthweight distributions and fetal-infant mortality. The present paper is the first of a two-part series that introduces such a framework. METHODS: We propose describing a birthweight distribution via a normal mixture model in which the number of components is determined from the data using a model selection criterion rather than fixed a priori. RESULTS: We address a number of methodological issues, including how the number of components selected depends on the sample size, how the choice of model selection criterion influences the results, and how estimates of mixture model parameters based on multiple samples from the same population can be combined to produce confidence intervals. As an illustration, we find that a 4-component normal mixture model reasonably describes the birthweight distribution for a population of white singleton infants born to heavily smoking mothers. We also compare this 4-component normal mixture model to two competitors from the existing literature: a contaminated normal model and a 2-component normal mixture model. In a second illustration, we discover that a 6-component normal mixture model may be more appropriate than a 4-component normal mixture model for a general population of black singletons. CONCLUSIONS: The framework developed in this paper avoids assuming the existence of an interval of birthweights over which there are no compromised pregnancies and does not constrain birthweights within compromised pregnancies to be normally distributed. Thus, the present framework can reveal heterogeneity in birthweight that is undetectable via a contaminated normal model or a 2-component normal mixture model.},

@article{Howe2011,
abstract = {In time-to-event analyses, artificial censoring with correction for induced selection bias using inverse probability-of-censoring weights can be used to 1) examine the natural history of a disease after effective interventions are widely available, 2) correct bias due to noncompliance with fixed or dynamic treatment regimens, and 3) estimate survival in the presence of competing risks. Artificial censoring entails censoring participants when they meet a predefined study criterion, such as exposure to an intervention, failure to comply, or the occurrence of a competing outcome. Inverse probability-of-censoring weights use measured common predictors of the artificial censoring mechanism and the outcome of interest to determine what the survival experience of the artificially censored participants would be had they never been exposed to the intervention, complied with their treatment regimen, or not developed the competing outcome. Even if all common predictors are appropriately measured and taken into account, in the context of small sample size and strong selection bias, inverse probability-of-censoring weights could fail because of violations in assumptions necessary to correct selection bias. The authors used an example from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, 1984-2008, regarding estimation of long-term acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-free survival to demonstrate the impact of violations in necessary assumptions. Approaches to improve correction methods are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not clear to what extent maternal metabolism during pregnancy affects the cognitive and behavioral function of the offspring by altering brain development in utero. To investigate this question, we correlated measures of metabolism in pregnant diabetic and nondiabetic women with the intellectual development of their offspring. METHODS: The study included 223 pregnant women and their singleton offspring: 89 women had diabetes before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes mellitus), 99 had the onset of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus), and 35 had normal carbohydrate metabolism during their pregnancy. We correlated measures of maternal glucose and lipid metabolism (fasting plasma glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c levels, episodes of hypoglycemia, episodes of acetonuria, and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels) with two measures of intellectual development in the offspring--the mental development index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, given at the age of two years, and the Stanford--Binet Intelligence Scale, given at the ages of three, four, and five years and expressed as an average of the three scores. RESULTS: After correction for socioeconomic status, race or ethnic origin, and patient group, the children's mental-development-index scores at the age of two years correlated inversely with the mothers' third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (r = -0.21, P less than 0.01); the average Stanford-Binet scores correlated inversely with third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (r = -0.20, P less than 0.02) and free fatty acid (r = -0.27, P less than 0.002) levels. No other correlations were significant. Including various perinatal events (e.g., prematurity and acidemia) in the analyses did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes during pregnancy may affect behavioral and intellectual development in the offspring. The associations between gestational ketonemia in the mother and a lower IQ in the child warrant continued efforts to avoid ketoacidosis and accelerated starvation in all pregnant women.},

abstract = {Purpose: Exposure to nature, particularly vegetation (greenness), may be beneficial for mental health. We investigated whether higher surrounding greenness in early life was associated with subsequent reduced risk of depressive symptoms and whether this association was modified by age, sex, or population density. Methods: Participants from the Growing Up Today Study were included if they reported on depressive symptoms between 1999 and 2013. Greenness exposure was characterized as the cumulative average normalized difference vegetation index value (1000 m resolution) from 1989 until 2 years before outcome assessment or age 18 based on geocoded addresses. We defined high depressive symptoms as the top 10{\%} of scores on the McKnight Risk Factor Survey or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, depending on the questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for socioeconomic status and other confounders. Results: There was a 6{\%} lower incidence of high depressive symptoms associated with an interquartile range increase in greenness (95{\%} confidence interval, 11{\%}–0{\%}). This relationship was stronger in higher population density areas ({\textgreater}1000 people/mi2, 8{\%} lower incidence, 95{\%} confidence interval 15{\%}–1{\%}). Conclusions: Living in an area with greater surrounding greenness during childhood may be beneficial for mental health, particularly in more urban areas.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test whether the experience of being bullied has an environmentally mediated effect on internalizing symptoms in young children. DESIGN: A genetically informative, longitudinal 1994-1995 birth cohort. SETTING: A nationally representative sample from the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: We examined 1116 twin pairs who are participants in the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study. Main Exposure The experience of being bullied between the ages of 7 and 9 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mothers' and teachers' reports of children's internalizing problems at 7 and 10 years of age. RESULTS: Monozygotic twins who had been bullied had more internalizing symptoms (mean, 0.23; SD, 1.00) compared with their co-twin who had not been bullied (mean, -0.13; SD, 0.86), indicating that being bullied has an environmentally mediated effect on children's internalizing problems (beta, 0.36 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.18-0.54]). This effect remained significant after controlling for preexisting internalizing problems (beta, 0.26 [95{\%} CI, 0.09-0.44]). CONCLUSIONS: Being bullied at a young age is an environmentally mediated contributing factor to children's internalizing problems. Intervention programs aimed at reducing bullying behavior in schools and in the community have the potential to influence children's early symptoms of mental health problems.},

abstract = {Although previous systematic reviews considered the relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, almost 200 peer-reviewed articles have been published since the last review on that topic, and this paper focuses specifically on education, which has different implications. The authors systematically review the peer-reviewed literature from around the world considering the association between educational attainment and obesity. Databases from public health and medicine, education, psychology, economics, and other social sciences were searched, and articles published in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish were included. This paper includes 289 articles that report on 410 populations in 91 countries. The relationship between educational attainment and obesity was modified by both gender and the country's economic development level: an inverse association was more common in studies of higher-income countries and a positive association was more common in lower-income countries, with stronger social patterning among women. Relatively few studies reported on lower-income countries, controlled for a comprehensive set of potential confounding variables and/or attempted to assess causality through the use of quasi-experimental designs. Future research should address these gaps to understand if the relationship between educational attainment and obesity may be causal, thus supporting education policy as a tool for obesity prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lack of a non-invasive diagnostic test contributes to the long delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of endometriosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined performance of six potential plasma biomarkers in the diagnosis of endometriosis. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in 294 infertile women, consisting of 93 women with a normal pelvis and 201 women with endometriosis. We measured plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and cancer antigens CA-125 and CA-19-9. Analyses were done using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test, receiver operator characteristic, stepwise logistic regression and least squares support vector machines (LSSVM). RESULTS: Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and CA-125 were increased in all women with endometriosis and in those with minimal-mild endometriosis, compared with controls. In women with moderate-severe endometriosis, plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and CA-125, but also of hsCRP, were significantly higher than in controls. Using stepwise logistic regression, moderate-severe endometriosis was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 100{\%} (specificity 84{\%}) and minimal-mild endometriosis was detected with a sensitivity of 87{\%} (specificity 71{\%}) during the secretory phase. Using LSSVM analysis, minimal-mild endometriosis was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 94{\%} (specificity 61{\%}) during the secretory phase and with a sensitivity of 92{\%} (specificity 63{\%}) during the menstrual phase. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced statistical analysis of a panel of six selected plasma biomarkers on samples obtained during the secretory phase or during menstruation allows the diagnosis of both minimal-mild and moderate-severe endometriosis with high sensitivity and clinically acceptable specificity.},

abstract = {The case-cohort design can be an economic alternative to the standard cohort design. Prentice (Biometrika 1986;73:1-11) showed how the case-cohort design can be used to obtain relative risk estimates for comparisons within the cohort being studied. In this paper, the authors consider ways in which the case-cohort design can be used for comparing risk in exposure groups within the cohort to the risk in an external population. The problem reduces to estimating the number of expected cases at each exposure level in the total cohort, when exposure status is available only for members of a subcohort, i.e., a random sample of the total cohort. The authors describe theoretical and empirical properties of several variations of the design and analysis of case-cohort studies. Empirical properties were examined by replicating the selection of the subcohort in a study of second cancer risk after chemotherapy for a first cancer. Use of a case-cohort design in that study would have saved five-sixths of the cost of gathering covariate information at the price of only an 11{\%} loss in efficiency relative to a full cohort study.},

We also present (1) a description of the connection between 4 causal models-counterfactuals, causal directed acyclic graphs, nonparametric structural equation models, and linear structural equation models-that have been used to describe instrumental variables methods; (2) a unified presentation of IV methods for the average causal effect in the study population through structural mean models; and (3) a discussion and new extensions of instrumental variables methods based on assumptions of monotonicity.},

We examined whether risk alleles for an increased body mass index (BMI) are associated with ADHD and related quantitative traits (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity). We screened 32 obesity risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for ADHD based on 495 patients and 1,300 population-based controls and performed in silico analyses of the SNPs in an ADHD meta-analysis comprising 2,064 trios, 896 independent cases, and 2,455 controls. In the German sample rs206936 in the NUDT3 gene (nudix; nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type motif 3) was associated with ADHD risk (OR: 1.39; P = 3.4 × 10(-4) ; Pcorr  = 0.01). In the meta-analysis data we found rs6497416 in the intronic region of the GPRC5B gene (G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member B; P = 7.2 × 10(-4) ; Pcorr  = 0.02) as a risk allele for ADHD. GPRC5B belongs to the metabotropic glutamate receptor family, which has been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. In the German sample rs206936 (NUDT3) and rs10938397 in the glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 gene (GNPDA2) were associated with inattention, whereas markers in the mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 gene (MAP2K5) and in the cell adhesion molecule 2 gene (CADM2) were associated with hyperactivity. In the meta-analysis data, MAP2K5 was associated with inattention, GPRC5B with hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention and CADM2 with hyperactivity/impulsivity. Our results justify further research on the elucidation of the common genetic background of ADHD and obesity.},

Design: Prospective study (study sample); retrospective record review (test sample). Setting: Hospital of Desio (study sample) and Mangiagalli Hospital (test sample), Italy. Patient(s): Ninety women scheduled to undergo laparoscopy or laparotomy (study sample); 120 women who underwent laparoscopy (test sample). Intervention: The study sample group was interviewed before surgery about infertility and dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and noncyclic pelvic pain and each member had a pelvic examination and a transvaginal ultrasound. At surgery, endometriosis was noted. For the test sample, the same information was abstracted from medical records after laparoscopy. Main Outcome Measure(s): The ability of symptoms, signs, and ultrasound to predict endometriosis at surgery. A classification tree was developed with the study sample and evaluated with the test sample. Result(s): Ovarian endometriosis, but not nonovarian endometriosis, could be reliably predicted with noninvasive tools. Ultrasound and examination best predicted ovarian endometriosis, correctly classifying 100{\%} of cases with no false positive diagnoses in the study sample. Similar results were found in the test sample. Conclusion(s): Noninvasive tools may be used to identify women with ovarian, but not nonovarian endometriosis, with excellent agreement with surgical diagnosis.},

While a large number of studies were identified that evaluated various outcomes of prenatal drug exposure, only 37 were found that directly evaluated challenging behaviors. Of the 37 studies, 23 focused on prenatal cocaine exposure, and 14 focused on prenatal alcohol exposure; most studies relied on broadband measures such as the CBCL for the assessment of challenging behavior. Among the 37 studies, a clear role for the postnatal environment on developing challenging behaviors was evident; however, prenatal alcohol exposure showed a much clearer independent effect upon challenging behaviors than was noted in the prenatal cocaine studies. Additionally, only 3 of the 37 studies addressed interventions for challenging behaviors, each of which showed an improvement in child behavior or parent-child interactions. As researchers have continued to show the importance of the postnatal environment, it is likely that interventions addressing specific environmental risk factors will be helpful to reduce or prevent challenging behaviors among this population.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Using data collected in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study, we examined the association between GUI and gastroschisis. From 1998 to 2010, mothers of 249 gastroschisis cases and 7,104 controls were interviewed within 6 months of delivery about pregnancy events, including vaginal infections, genital herpes, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Women were considered exposed if they reported at least 1 instance of a GUI in the first trimester. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals. Women who reported having any GUI had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.8 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.4). The highest risk was seen among women who reported a UTI only (adjusted odds ratio = 2.3, 95{\%} CI: 1.5, 3.5), while the odds ratio for an STD only was slightly elevated (adjusted odds ratio = 1.2, 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.5). Among women under 25 years of age, the odds ratio for UTI only was 2.6 (95{\%} CI: 1.7, 4.0), and among older women it was 1.8 (95{\%} CI: 0.6, 5.9). When we considered the joint association of UTIs and young maternal age, a synergistic effect was observed. The results of this study add further evidence that UTIs may increase the risk of gastroschisis.},

abstract = {The diversity of biological effects resulting from exposure to dioxin may reflect the ability of this environmental pollutant to alter gene expression by binding to the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene and related genes. AHR function may be regulated by structural variations in AHR itself, in the AHR repressor (AHRR), in the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), or in AHR target molecules such as cytochrome P-4501A1 (CYP1A1) and glutathione S-transferase. Analysis of the genomic organization of AHRR revealed an open reading frame consisting of a 2094-bp mRNA encoded by ten exons. We found one novel polymorphism, a substitution of Ala by Pro at codon 185 (GCC to CCC), in exon 5 of the AHRR gene; among 108 healthy unrelated Japanese women, genotypes Ala/Ala, Ala/Pro, and Pro/Pro were represented, respectively, by 20 (18.5{\%}), 49 (45.4{\%}), and 39 (36.1{\%}) individuals. We did not detect previously published polymorphisms of ARNT (D511N) or the CYP1A1 promoter (G-469A and C-459T) in our subjects, suggesting that these polymorphisms are rare in the Japanese population. No association was found between uterine endometriosis and any polymorphisms in the AHRR, AHR, ARNT, or CYP1A1 genes analyzed in the present study.},

abstract = {Summary The goal of mediation analysis is to assess direct and indirect effects of a treatment or exposure on an outcome. More generally, we may be interested in the context of a causal model as characterized by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where mediation via a specific path from exposure to outcome may involve an arbitrary number of links (or "stages"). Methods for estimating mediation (or pathway) effects are available for a continuous outcome and a continuous mediator related via a linear model, while for a categorical outcome or categorical mediator, methods are usually limited to two-stage mediation. We present a method applicable to multiple stages of mediation and mixed variable types using generalized linear models. We define pathway effects using a potential outcomes framework and present a general formula that provides the effect of exposure through any specified pathway. Some pathway effects are nonidentifiable and their estimation requires an assumption regarding the correlation between counterfactuals. We provide a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of this assumption. Confidence intervals for pathway effect estimates are obtained via a bootstrap method. The method is applied to a cohort study of dental caries in very low birth weight adolescents. A simulation study demonstrates low bias of pathway effect estimators and close-to-nominal coverage rates of confidence intervals. We also find low sensitivity to the counterfactual correlation in most scenarios.},

In 2005, the stillbirth rate (fetal deaths ≥ 20 weeks' gestation per 1000 fetal deaths and live births) for non-Hispanic blacks was 11.13 compared with 4.79 for non-Hispanic whites. Rates were intermediate for American Indian or Alaska Natives (6.17) and Hispanics (5.44). There is racial disparity for both early ({\textless} 28 weeks' gestation) and late stillbirths. We review available data regarding risk factors for stillbirth with a focus on those factors that are more prevalent in certain racial/ethnic groups and those factors that appear to have a more profound effect in certain racial/ethnic groups. Although many factors, including genetics, environment, stress, social issues, access to and quality of medical care and behavior, contribute to racial disparity in stillbirth, the reasons for the disparity remain unclear. Knowledge gaps and recommendations for further research and interventions intended to reduce racial disparity in stillbirth are highlighted.},

abstract = {Healthy worker survivor bias may occur in occupational studies due to the tendency for unhealthy individuals to leave work earlier, and consequently accrue less exposure, compared with their healthier counterparts. If occupational data are not analyzed using appropriate methods, this bias can result in attenuation or even reversal of the estimated effects of exposures on health outcomes. Recent advances in computing power, coupled with state-of-the-art statistical methods, have greatly increased the ability of analysts to control healthy worker survivor bias. However, these methods have not been widely adopted by occupational epidemiologists. We update the seminal review by Arrighi and Hertz-Picciotto (Epidemiology.1994; 5: 186-196) of the sources and methods to control healthy worker survivor bias. In our update, we discuss methodologic advances since the publication of that review, notably with a consideration of how directed acyclic graphs can inform the choice of appropriate analytic methods. We summarize and discuss methods for addressing this bias, including recent work applying g-methods to account for employment status as a time-varying covariate affected by prior exposure. In the presence of healthy worker survivor bias, g-methods have advantages for estimating less biased parameters that have direct policy implications and are clearly communicated to decision-makers.},

abstract = {Generalizing empirical findings to new environments, settings, or populations is essential in most scientific explorations. This article treats a particular problem of generalizability, called "transportability", defined as a license to transfer information learned in experimental studies to a different population, on which only observational studies can be conducted. Given a set of assumptions concerning commonalities and differences between the two populations, Pearl and Bareinboim (2011) derived sufficient conditions that permit such transfer to take place. This article summarizes their findings and supplements them with an effective procedure for deciding when and how transportability is feasible. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target population are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments. The article further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of combining observational and experimental information to synthesize bias-free estimate of the desired causal relation. Finally, the article examines the differences between transportability and other variants of generalizability.},

Problems found in these studies were grouped into three categories: subject and methods issues, environmental factors, and outcome measurement. The combined average intelligence quotient/developmental quotient (IQ/DQ) of all low birth weight groups was 97.77 (SD 6.19); for control subjects the mean IQ/DQ was 103.78 (SD 8.16). This difference was statistically significant but perhaps not clinically significant. No differences in mean IQ/DQ scores were found among the low birth weight, very low birth weight, and extremely low birth weight subgroups. Statistically significant differences among all groups and control subjects were found when categoric data were analyzed, as were differences among the three subgroups; however, the variety of outcome criteria makes interpretation of the categoric analyses difficult.},

Here we provide a primer on maximum likelihood and some important extensions which have proven useful in epidemiologic research, and which reveal connections between maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. For a given data set and probability model, maximum likelihood finds values of the model parameters that give the observed data the highest probability. As with all inferential statistical methods, maximum likelihood is based on an assumed model and cannot account for bias sources that are not controlled by the model or the study design. Maximum likelihood is nonetheless popular, because it is computationally straightforward and intuitive and because maximum likelihood estimators have desirable large-sample properties in the (largely fictitious) case in which the model has been correctly specified. Here, we work through an example to illustrate the mechanics of maximum likelihood estimation and indicate how improvements can be made easily with commercial software. We then describe recent extensions and generalizations which are better suited to observational health research and which should arguably replace standard maximum likelihood as the default method.},

Less well understood are the mechanisms that account for neurodevelopmental disorders arising from maternal inflammation. This review seeks to begin an examination of possible sites and mechanisms of action whereby inflammatory cytokines - produced by the mother or by the fetal brain - could impact the developing fetus. We focus first on the placenta where cytokines maintain the immunological environment that prevents maternal rejection of the fetus. Following a brief examination of placental transfer of maternal cytokines, the focus turns on embryonic microglia, early and ubiquitous residents of the developing brain. Finally, a more intense examination of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) provides examples of glial- or maternal-derived cytokines that are known to have profound effects on developing systems and that could, if dysregulated, have undesirable consequences for brain development.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy in terms of birth weight and infant survival of a diet supplement programme in pregnant African women through a primary healthcare system. DESIGN: 5 year controlled trial of all pregnant women in 28 villages randomised to daily supplementation with high energy groundnut biscuits (4.3 MJ/day) for about 20 weeks before delivery (intervention) or after delivery (control). SETTING: Rural Gambia. SUBJECTS: Chronically undernourished women (twin bearers excluded), yielding 2047 singleton live births and 35 stillbirths. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Birth weight; prevalence of low birth weight ({\textless} 2500 g); head circumference; birth length; gestational age; prevalence of stillbirths; neonatal and postneonatal mortality. RESULTS: Supplementation increased weight gain in pregnancy and significantly increased birth weight, particularly during the nutritionally debilitating hungry season (June to October). Weight gain increased by 201 g (P {\textless} 0.001) in the hungry season, by 94 g (P {\textless} 0.01) in the harvest season (November to May), and by 136 g (P {\textless} 0.001) over the whole year. The odds ratio for low birthweight babies in supplemented women was 0.61 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.47 to 0.79, P {\textless} 0.001). Head circumference was significantly increased (P {\textless} 0.01), but by only 3.1 mm. Birth length and duration of gestation were not affected. Supplementation significantly reduced perinatal mortality: the odds ratio was 0.47 (0.23 to 0.99, P {\textless} 0.05) for stillbirths and 0.54 (0.35 to 0.85, P {\textless} 0.01) for all deaths in first week of life. Mortality after 7 days was unaffected. CONCLUSION: Prenatal dietary supplementation reduced retardation in intrauterine growth when effectively targeted at genuinely at-risk mothers. This was associated with a substantial reduction in the prevalence of stillbirths and in early neonatal mortality. The intervention can be successfully delivered through a primary healthcare system.},

abstract = {Maternal obesity in pregnancy is associated with a number of adverse outcomes for mother and her offspring both perinatally and later in life. This includes recent evidence that suggests that obesity in pregnancy may be associated with central nervous system problems in the foetus and newborn. Here, we systematically review studies that have explored associations between maternal overweight and obesity in pregnancy and cognitive, behavioural and emotional problems in offspring. The  12 studies eligible for this review examined a wide range of outcomes across the  lifespan and eight provided evidence of a link. These data suggest that the offspring of obese pregnancies may be at increased risk of cognitive problems and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood, eating disorders in adolescence and psychotic disorders in adulthood. Given the limitations of existing data, these findings warrant further study, particularly  in light of the current worldwide obesity epidemic.},
annote = {systematic review


"At delivery, obese women are 20{\%} more likely than normal weight women to suffer perinatal haemorrhage and three times more likely to develop an infection. They are less likely to breastfeed and are more prone to lactation delay and failure than normal weight women. Obese mothers are also twice as likely to give birth to macrosomic infants who themselves have higher rates of birth trauma and perinatal asphyxia." (all refs)

"If maternal obesity does adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring later in life, it is not clear if this occurs via a direct programming effect or if obesity simply serves as a marker of the actual pre- or post-natal causal factors."

"dys-regulation of maternal hormonal or immune system, or even nutrient excesses."

"marker of problems known to affect overweight mothers and that also influence foetal neurodevelopment such as folate or vitamin D deficiency."

pregnancy exposures common to obese women -- DM, exposure to traumatic events during pregnancy, perinatal depression

obstetric complications or child health problems such as obesity or DM

"Maternal cognitive problems (20), maladaptive personality traits (21), frank psychiatric disorder (22) or even exposure to poverty might not only increase a mother's risk of obesity, but also affect the risk of foetal neurodevelopmental problems independent of the intrauterine state associated with maternal obesity."

"All three of the studies that adjusted for both types of confounders [familial/genetic risk, potential post-natal socioeconomic confounders that are likely to have been present pre-natally) provided some support for an association (25, 30, 31)"

can't make firm conclusions about when maternal obesity is most deleterious, but seems to be first/second as opposed to third (look at Kawai (34)

overall conclusion of this systematic review -- maternal obesity prior to and during pregnancy increased risk of neuro

obese pregnancy: increased estrogen (45), cortisol (46), pro-imflammatory cytokines (48), oxidative stress (49)

sympathetic nervous system overactivity (50)

breastfeeding

stress, stress sensitivity (52-53)

"Future studies in the area of maternal obesity in pregnancy and neurodevelopmental problems in offspring should focus on obtaining unbiased risk estimates by using direct measurements of height and weight if possible, examining a broad range of outcomes across the lifespan, utilizing generalizeable samples and validated assessments of outcome and adjusting for putative confounders."},

abstract = {Identification of new molecular targets for the treatment of breast cancer is an important clinical goal, especially for triple-negative breast cancer, which is refractory to existing targeted treatments. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor known primarily as the mediator of dioxin toxicity. However, the AhR can also inhibit cellular proliferation in a ligand-dependent manner and act as a tumor suppressor in mice, and thus may be a potential anticancer target. To investigate the AhR as an anticancer target, we conducted a small molecule screen to discover novel AhR ligands with anticancer properties. We identified raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator currently used in the clinic for prevention of ER-positive breast cancer and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, as an AhR activator. Raloxifene directly bound the AhR and induced apoptosis in ER-negative mouse and human hepatoma cells in an AhR-dependent manner, indicating that the AhR is a molecular target of raloxifene and mediates raloxifene-induced apoptosis in the absence of ER. Raloxifene selectively induced apoptosis of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared with non-transformed mammary epithelial cells via the AhR. Combined with recent data showing that raloxifene inhibits triple-negative breast cancer xenografts in vivo (Int J Oncol. 43(3):785-92, 2013), our results support the possibility of repurposing of raloxifene as an AhR-targeted therapeutic for triple-negative breast cancer patients. To this end, we also evaluated the role of AhR expression on survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. We found that higher expression of the AhR is significantly associated with increased overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in both hormone-dependent (ER-positive) and hormone-independent (ER and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative) breast cancers. Together, our data strongly support the possibility of using the AhR as a molecular target for the treatment of hormone-independent breast cancers.},

abstract = {Instrumental variables are routinely used to recover a consistent estimator of an exposure causal effect in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Instrumental variable approaches to account for nonignorable missing data also exist but are less familiar to epidemiologists. Like instrumental variables for exposure causal effects, instrumental variables for missing data rely on exclusion restriction and instrumental variable relevance assumptions. Yet these two conditions alone are insufficient for point identification. For estimation, researchers have invoked a third assumption, typically involving fairly restrictive parametric constraints. Inferences can be sensitive to these parametric assumptions, which are typically not empirically testable. The purpose of our article is to discuss another approach for leveraging a valid instrumental variable. Although the approach is insufficient for nonparametric identification, it can nonetheless provide informative inferences about the presence, direction, and magnitude of selection bias, without invoking a third untestable parametric assumption. An important contribution of this article is an Excel spreadsheet tool that can be used to obtain empirical evidence of selection bias and calculate bounds and corresponding Bayesian 95{\%} credible intervals for a nonidentifiable population proportion. For illustrative purposes, we used the spreadsheet tool to analyze HIV prevalence data collected by the 2007 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).},

The aim of this report is to present the effect of two steps in reduction of the number of embryos transferred, when applied in the majority of the patients, on national data for delivery and MBR after IVF in Sweden. METHODS This observational study is based on annual reports from all IVF clinics in Sweden to the National Board of Health and Welfare for the time period 1991-2004. RESULTS The main finding is that despite a successive reduction in the number of embryos transferred, delivery rates were maintained at around 26{\%} while MBR decreased dramatically, from about 35{\%} to around 5{\%}. The same pattern was noticed, independent of age, for all women below 40. In comparison with the USA, lower delivery and MBR were noted for Sweden whereas a higher 'birth per embryo transferred' was found. CONCLUSIONS Single embryo transfer (SET) results in satisfactory delivery rates and a dramatic decrease in the MBRs, also when applied on a broad scale. The experience from Sweden ought to encourage other countries to introduce SET more widely.},

In this paper,we develop newalgorithms for the implementation of the G-computation estimators of bothNPMSMand PMSMcausal effects. Current algorithms rely on Monte Carlo simulation of all possible treatment-specific outcomes, also referred to as counterfactuals or potential outcomes. This task becomes computationally impracticable (a) in studies with a continuous treatment, and/or (b) in longitudinal studies with long follow-up with or without time-dependent outcomes.The proposed algorithms address this important computing limitation inherent to G-computation estimation in most longitudinal studies. Finally, practical considerations about the proposed algorithms lead to a further generalization of the definition of NPMSM causal effects in order to allow more reliable applications of these methodologies to a broader range of real-life studies.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Exposure to ambient air pollution is widespread and may be detrimental to human brain development and a potential risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We conducted a systematic review of the human evidence on the relationship between ASD and exposure to all airborne pollutants, including particulate matter air pollutants and others (e.g. pesticides and metals). OBJECTIVE To answer the question: "is developmental exposure to air pollution associated with ASD?" METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, identified relevant studies using inclusion/exclusion criteria pre-specified in our protocol (registered in PROSPERO, CRD {\#} 42015017890), evaluated the potential risk of bias for each included study and identified an appropriate subset of studies to combine in a meta-analysis. We then rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence collectively across all air pollutants. RESULTS Of 1,158 total references identified, 23 human studies met our inclusion criteria (17 case-control, 4 ecological, 2 cohort). Risk of bias was generally low across studies for most domains; study limitations were related to potential confounding and accuracy of exposure assessment methods. We rated the quality of the body of evidence across all air pollutants as "moderate." From our meta-analysis, we found statistically significant summary odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (95{\%} CI: 1.06, 1.08) per 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 exposure (n = 6 studies) and 2.32 (95{\%} CI: 2.15, 2.51) per 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (n = 3 studies). For pollutants not included in a meta-analysis, we collectively evaluated evidence from each study in rating the strength and quality of overall evidence considering factors such as inconsistency, imprecision, and evidence of dose-response. All included studies generally showed increased risk of ASD with increasing exposure to air pollution, although not consistently across all chemical components. CONCLUSION After considering strengths and limitations of the body of research, we concluded that there is "limited evidence of toxicity" for the association between early life exposure to air pollution as a whole and diagnosis of ASD. The strongest evidence was between prenatal exposure to particulate matter and ASD. However, the small number of studies in the meta-analysis and unexplained statistical heterogeneity across the individual study estimates means that the effect could be larger or smaller (including not significant) than these studies estimate. Our research supports the need for health protective public policy to reduce exposures to harmful airborne contaminants among pregnant women and children and suggests opportunities for optimizing future research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The micronutrient depletion hypothesis proposes that consecutive pregnancies spaced too closely may leave insufficient time for maternal micronutrient replenishment. Short interpregnancy intervals (IPI) have been associated with an increased risk for several adverse pregnancy outcomes, but an association with gastroschisis risk has not been previously explored. METHODS Within a population-based, case-control study, we evaluated the association between IPI length and gastroschisis risk using multivariable logistic regression models to estimate gastroschisis odds ratios for IPI {\textless}12 months and 12 to 17 months relative to those 18 to 23 months. We further evaluated the association between IPI and gastroschisis risk stratified by maternal age, periconceptional multivitamin use, preceding pregnancy outcome, study center region, and season of conception to explore whether observed associations were compatible with the hypothesis of maternal micronutrient depletion. RESULTS For women with IPI {\textless}12 months, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 1.7 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.1–2.5). The magnitude of the observed effect did not differ among strata of maternal age or periconceptional multivitamin use. However, the association was more pronounced after a miscarriage or termination (aOR: 2.5; 95{\%} CI: 1.1–5.6) and among women who resided in northern study areas (aOR: 2.8; 95{\%} CI: 1.3–5.9). The higher risk observed with short IPI among women in northern study areas was attenuated for spring/summer conceptions. CONCLUSION Short IPI was associated with an increased risk for gastroschisis, particularly among women whose preceding pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage or termination and among those who resided in northern study areas with winter/fall conception.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that maternal birth weight was associated with the risk of cesarean delivery for nulliparous women. STUDY DESIGN: In a population-based cohort study, maternal birth data were linked to a Washington State database, including the birth certificates of 18,905 first-born singleton infants (1987-1995). RESULTS: Among non-Hispanic white subjects, maternal birth weight of 2500 to 3999 g was associated with a 20.9{\%} risk of cesarean delivery, which was the lowest risk, compared with 24.5{\%} for a maternal birth weight {\textless}2500 g (P {\textless}.05) and 24.0{\%} for a maternal birth weight {\textgreater} or =4000 g (P {\textless}.05). Similar patterns of risk were noted among Hispanic and Native American subjects, although the associations did not reach statistical significance. Risk of cesarean delivery was not associated with maternal birth weight among African American subjects. Among non-Hispanic white subjects, the risk of cesarean delivery was 3.23 times greater with a maternal birth weight {\textless}2500 g and an infant birth weight {\textgreater} or =4000 g compared with pregnancies with both maternal and infant birth weights between 2500 and 3999 g (P {\textless}. 001). Adjustment for socioeconomic factors did not alter these results. CONCLUSION: Low and high maternal birth weights exert an intergenerational risk of cesarean delivery in nulliparous non-Hispanic white women.},

abstract = {Metabolic stressful challenges during susceptible time windows, such as fetal life, can have important implications for health throughout life. Deletion of the p66(Shc) gene in mice leads to reduced oxidative stress (OS), resulting in a healthy and lean phenotype characterized by increased metabolic rate, resistance to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and reduced emotionality at adulthood. Here we hypothesize that p66(Shc-/-) (KO) adult offspring might be protected from the detrimental effects induced by maternal HFD administered before and during pregnancy. To test such hypothesis, we fed p66(Shc+/+) (WT) and KO females with HFD for 13 weeks starting on 5 weeks of age until delivery and tested adult male and female offspring for their metabolic, neuroendocrine, and emotional profile. Prenatal diet affected stress responses and metabolic features in a gender-dependent fashion. In particular, prenatal HFD increased plasma leptin levels and decreased anxiety-like behavior in females, while increasing body weight, particularly in KO subjects. KO mice were overall characterized by metabolic resiliency, showing a blunted change in glycemia levels in response to glucose or insulin challenges. However, in p66(Shc-/-) mice, prenatal HFD affected glucose tolerance response in an opposite manner in the two genders, overriding the resilience in males and exacerbating it in females. Finally, KO females were protected from the disrupting effect of prenatal HFD on neuroendocrine response. These findings indicate that prenatal HFD alters the emotional profile and metabolic functionality of the adult individual in a gender-dependent fashion and suggest that exposure to high-caloric food during fetal life is a stressful condition interfering with the developmental programming of the adult phenotype. Deletion of the p66(Shc) gene attenuates such effects, acting as a protective factor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk of offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the role of unmeasured familial confounding for this association remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study via linkage of Swedish national and regional registers to investigate maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (underweight: BMI {\textless}18.5; overweight: 25≤ BMI {\textless}30; obesity: BMI ≥30) in relation to offspring ADHD. We followed 673 632 individuals born in Sweden between 1992 and 2000, with prospectively collected information on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, until they received an ADHD diagnosis or ADHD medication, death, emigration or 31 December 2009.

"pre-pregnancy obesity might represent a genetic predisposition rather than a causal risk factor for offspring ADHD (18). Time-invariant family-wide environmental factors influencing both mothers and their children may also explain the observed associations."

19 -- animal experiment

individuals born in Sweden from 1992-2000

673,632 individuals eligible and with prepreg BMI data

272790 full biological siblings within 130,060 families

"Individuals with missing values for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI were more likely to have an ADHD diagnosis compared to individuals without missing values." (also foreign born, lower education, older at delivery, smokers during pregnancy, less likely to be living with father)

covariates: sex, birth order, year of birth, mother's country of birth, maternal education, maternal age, smoking, cohabitation with father

"Paired t-testing was used to examine the mean and the standard deviation (SD) or the difference in maternal BMI between discordantly exposed siblings. Stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used for sibling comparisons with a separate stratum for each set of full siblings."

"The analyses estimated the association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring ADHD using within-mother variation in BMI. Siblings discordant for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI contribute with the main information, but siblings differentially exposed to any other covariates are also informative for the within-family analyses."

Crude, population-level analyses: ADHD associated with underweight, overweight, and obesity. After adjustment, hazard ratios slightly attenuated but remained (1.23 overweight, 1.64 obese) except for underweight

19,814 families with siblings discordant for maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity

Among these families, 892 contained siblings discordant also for ADHD -- within sibling analyses basically attenuated to the null

"Future research needs to elucidate the nature of the familial confounding. In view of the evidence supporting a genetic overlap between overweight/obesity and ADHD, for instance, via genetic variants related to the dopaminergic reward system (31), we predict that the familial confounding may be genetic in origin."

"weight gain and weight loss between pregnancies may represent different biological processes (e.g. weight-regulatory system more effective for the protection against weight loss than weight gain) (35) and the impact of familial confounding may differ between the two types of between-pregnancy variation in BMI"

"BMI might not represent an optimal proxy for overweight/obesity-related suboptimal metabolic conditions, indicating that future research needs to explore how more specific assessments of metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, relate to offspring ADHD.... fture research needs to explore the association between offspring ADHD and developmental trajectories of maternal body weight through pregnancy},

abstract = {Missing data is a common occurrence in epidemiologic research. In this paper, 3 data sets with induced missing values from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a multisite US study conducted from 1959 to 1974, are provided as examples of prototypical epidemiologic studies with missing data. Our goal was to estimate the association of maternal smoking behav-ior with spontaneous abortion while adjusting for numerous confounders. At the same time, we did not necessarily wish to evaluate the joint distribution among potentially unobserved covariates, which is seldom the subject of substantive scien-tific interest. The inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach preserves the semiparametric structure of the underlying model of substantive interest and clearly separates the model of substantive interest from the model used to account for the missing data. However, IPW often will not result in valid inference if the missing-data pattern is nonmonotone, even if the data are missing at random. We describe a recently proposed approach to modeling nonmonotone missing-data mechanisms under missingness at random to use in constructing the weights in IPW complete-case estimation, and we illustrate the approach using 3 data sets described in a companion article (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;000(00):000–000).},

Both concepts are conditional on other covariates but the form this conditionality takes differs. Both concepts are also properties of the population, and both are relative to the specific exposure and to the specific outcome. For a particular population, the presence of confounding depends on how the exposure was assigned; the presence of effect modification does not. The possibility of confounding without effect modification and vice versa is discussed both with respect to distribution and measure.

Weighted kappa statistics were used to compare the classification of neurological development using US-based and Malawian norms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For all subtests, the mean raw scores in Malawian children were higher than the US normative scores at younger ages (approximately {\textless}6 months) after which the mean curves crossed and the US normative mean exceeded that of the Malawian sample and the age at which the curves crossed differed by subtest.

abstract = {There is a consensus that malaria is a growing problem in African highlands. This is surprising because many parts of the highlands were considered too cold to support transmission. In this report, we examined how transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in six villages changed along an altitude transect in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, from 300 m to 1700 m. Routine entomological collections were made using spray catches and light traps for 15 mo. Direct estimates of entomological inoculation rates and indirect estimates of vectorial capacity suggested a {\textgreater}1000-fold reduction in transmission intensity between the holoendemic lowland and the hypoendemic highland plateau. Lowland transmission was perennial with a significant peak in the cool season after the long rains in May, when vectors densities were high. In the highlands, low temperatures prevented parasite development in mosquitoes during the cool season rains, and highland transmission was therefore limited to the warm dry season when vector densities were low. The primary effect of increasing altitude was a log-linear reduction in vector abundance and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in the proportion of infective mosquitoes. Highland malaria transmission was maintained at extraordinarily low vector densities. We discuss herein the implications of these findings for modeling malaria and suggest that process-based models of malaria transmission risk should be improved by considering the direct effect of temperature on vector densities. Our findings suggest that variation in the short rains in November and changes in agricultural practices are likely to be important generators of epidemics in the Usambaras.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a rise in the prevalence of large newborns over a few decades in many parts of the world. There is ample evidence that fetal macrosomia is associated with increased risk of complications both for the mother and the newborn. In current obstetrics, the macrosomic fetus represents a frequent clinical challenge. Evidence is emerging that being born macrosomic is also associated with future health risks. OBJECTIVE: To provide a review of causes and risks, prevention, prediction and clinical management of suspected large fetus/fetal macrosomia, primarily aimed at clinical obstetricians. METHODS: Medline and EMBASE were searched between 1980 and 2007 by combining either 'fetal macrosomia' or 'large for gestational age' with other relevant terms. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for the term 'fetal macrosomia'. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although the causes of high birthweight include both genetic and environmental factors, the rapid increase in the prevalence of large newborns has environmental causes. The evidence is extensive that maternal overweight and associated metabolic changes, including type 2 and gestational diabetes, play a central role. There is a paucity of studies of the effect of intervention before and/or during pregnancy on the risk of having an 'overweight newborn'. It appears rational, however, that preventive measures should primarily be implemented before pregnancy and should include guidance about nutrition and physical activity in order to reduce the prevalence of overweight. In pregnancy, limited weight gain, especially in obese women, seems to reduce the risk of macrosomia, as do good control of plasma glucose among those with diabetes. Prediction of fetal macrosomia remains an inaccurate task even with modern ultrasound equipment. There is little evidence that routine elective delivery (induction or caesarean section) for the mere reason of suspected macrosomia should be employed in a general population. Vaginal delivery of a macrosomic fetus requires considered attention by an experienced obstetrician and preparedness for operative delivery, shoulder dystocia and newborn asphyxia.},

In a case crossover analysis, confounding by fixed (constant) characteristics is eliminated by pairing of cases to themselves, at the possible cost of introducing bias due to time trends in exposure. A case-time-control analysis can correct case-crossover results only for bias due to such time trends. If an uncontrolled confounder (such as disease severity) is present, the use of time controls can introduce new con founding, and the case time control results may end up either more or less confounded than the ordinary and case crossover results. The relative confounding in the different approaches depends on details of the relations among the unmeasured confounder, the study exposure, the study disease, and any trend in these variables or their effects. Like an ordinary study, a case-time-control study must assume absence of unmeasured confounders, whether fixed or time-varying. Like a case-crossover study, it must also assume absence of carryover effects and can be more prone to misclassification bias than an ordinary study.},

annote = {Endometriosis: Etiology and Epidemiology
Endometriosis is a gynecologic disease, considered benign, that can cause pelvic pain, painful menstruation, infertility, and painful intercourse in women, mostly between menarche and menopause. Defined by the presence of endometrial-type glands and stroma outside of the uterus, endometriosis can take several forms, including as endometriomas, which are blood-filled ovarian cysts, or as peritoneal lesions of such tissue. Occasionally endometriosis has been found in locations distant from the uterus, such as the lungs or limbs, or in scar tissue.5
The exact mechanisms of the disease have not been determined, and it is quite probable that several are possible, perhaps sometimes occurring simultaneously. The first to be suggested and still the most commonly quoted is the theory of retrograde menstruation, by which menstrual fluid regurgitated through the fallopian tubes would attach itself to tissue outside the uterus. This hypothesis is supported by the location of much endometriosis (the ovary, cul-de-sac, and uterosacral ligaments are the most common5) and by the fact that endometriosis is much more common in those women who have retrograde menstruation than those who don't.[i]
Further explanation is required, however, for the fact that most women have such retrograde menstruation.[ii] There is something therefore specific to women with endometriosis, perhaps an immunodeficiency that prevents the body from sufficiently cleaning this misplaced tissue out of the peritoneal cavity. Perhaps instead, some molecular abnormality in affected women allows the retrograde menstruation to stick, or perhaps it is some combination of the two hypotheses.11
Another etiological theory involves the dissemination of endometriotic tissue through lymphatic channels or through blood vessels, especially to the distant sites where it can appear, though this is difficult to prove.[iii] As endometriosis can also appear in the tissue of laparotomy or caesarian-section scars, perhaps it can also be directly implanted by way of a surgical instrument or something similar.5 Another possible explanation is that metaplasia of the peritoneal mesothelium can produce endometrial tissue.12
Though some risk factors for endometriosis have been ascertained, better knowledge about the mechanisms of the disease could greatly help the search for more. Furthermore, it is very difficult to get population-wide epidemiological data about endometriosis, as many cases are asymptomatic. In addition, diagnosis requires surgery, usually laparoscopic, which is not necessarily available at equal rates across a population, making the diagnosis itself a privileged one. It has been suggested that endometriosis is more frequent in higher socioeconomic groups, or among white Americans rather than African-Americans, but these difference may be attributed to lack of access to the diagnostic procedure.10
Estimates vary, but endometriosis appears to affect as little as 4{\%} or as much as 10{\%} of women of reproductive age. 11, [iv] Again, asymptomatic cases make these estimates difficult, but studies of women undergoing tubal ligation, with no previous diagnosis of endometriosis, have found that somewhere between 1-7{\%} of women without symptoms, or who fail to recognize they have them, could be surgically diagnosed with the disease.13
One of the main associations found with endometriosis is infertility, though this could be confounded by the fact that infertile women are more likely to be examined for a possible cause and therefore diagnosed with endometriosis. Similarly, pregnancy has been called a protective factor, though, similar to the case with ovarian cancer, this is hard to untangle from infertility.10
Some of the more certain protective factors are smoking and exercise, most likely because they can lead to estrogen deficiency.10 Conversely, alcohol use is a risk factor because of its ability to increase estrogen levels.13 On the whole, anything that raises estrogen appears to be problematic, as estrogen can allow endometriotic tissue to persist.11
As with ovarian cancer, family history is a strong predictor of endometriosis, raising the risk perhaps as much as seven-fold.11 Unlike the BRCA genes, however, there is currently no consensus on any “endometriosis gene.” Knowledge of family history is important in precipitating a diagnosis, as is infertility.

abstract = {Counter-intuitive associations appear frequently in epidemiology, and these results are often debated. In particular, several scenarios are characterized by a general risk factor that appears protective in particular subpopulations, for example, individuals suffering from a specific disease. However, the associations are not necessarily representing causal effects. Selection bias due to conditioning on a collider may often be involved, and causal graphs are widely used to highlight such biases. These graphs, however, are qualitative, and they do not provide information on the real life relevance of a spurious association. Quantitative estimates of such associations can be obtained from simple statistical models. In this study, we present several paradoxical associations that occur in epidemiology, and we explore these associations in a causal, frailty framework. By using frailty models, we are able to put numbers on spurious effects that often are neglected in epidemiology. We discuss several counter-intuitive findings that have been reported in real life analyses, and we present calculations that may expand the understanding of these associations. In particular, we derive novel expressions to explain the magnitude of bias in index-event studies.},

Questions about the neural bases of emotion regulation have recently taken on new importance, as functional imaging studies in humans have permitted direct investigation of control strategies that draw upon higher cognitive processes difficult to study in nonhumans. Such studies have examined (1) controlling attention to, and (2) cognitively changing the meaning of, emotionally evocative stimuli. These two forms of emotion regulation depend upon interactions between prefrontal and cingulate control systems and cortical and subcortical emotion-generative systems. Taken together, the results suggest a functional architecture for the cognitive control of emotion that dovetails with findings from other human and nonhuman research on emotion. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Selection bias and confounding are concerns in cohort studies where the reason for inclusion of subjects in the cohort may be related to the outcome of interest. Selection bias in prevalent cohorts is often corrected by excluding observation time and events during the first time period after inclusion in the cohort. This time period must be chosen carefully-long enough to minimize selection bias but not too long so as to unnecessarily discard observation time and events. A novel method visualizing and estimating selection bias is described and exemplified by using 2 real cohort study examples: a study of hepatitis C virus infection and a study of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The method is based on modeling the hazard for the outcome of interest as a function of time since inclusion in the cohort. The events studied were "hospitalizations for kidney-related disease" in the hepatitis C virus cohort and "death" in the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance cohort. Both cohorts show signs of considerable selection bias as evidenced by increased hazard in the time period after inclusion in the cohort. The method was very useful in visualizing selection bias and in determining the initial time period to be excluded from the analyses.},

These forms of antagonism include "synergy under recoding of an exposure," "synergism under recoding of the outcome," and so-called "competing response types," with synergism itself conceived of as causal co-action within the sufficient-cause framework. In this paper, the authors show that subadditivity necessarily implies at least one of these 3 forms of antagonism. Empirical conditions for specific forms of antagonism are given for settings in which monotonicity assumptions are and are not considered plausible. The implications of subadditivity and superadditivity for causal co-action for either an outcome or its absence are characterized under various assumptions about monotonicity. A simple computational procedure is described for assessing whether any specific form of causal co-action can be detected for either an outcome or its absence for both cohort and case-control data. The results in this paper are illustrated by application to examples drawn from the existing literature on gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.},

abstract = {In epidemiological studies it is often necessary to disentangle the pathways that link an exposure to an outcome. Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.},
annote = {The fact that the estimates of direct effect vary across different levels of the mediator implies that the exposure A and the mediator M interact in explaining the outcome.


In the absence of interaction between the exposure and the mediator, controlled direct effect and natrual direct effect are equivalent.

The presence of exposure-mediator ineraction may introduce large problems in mediation analysis and therefore should be considered whenver interpreting the results of traditional analyses.

to understand whether standard analyses designed to estimate controlled direct effects can provide interpretable estimates in terms of mechanisms, one of the they questions that needs to be posed is whether an interaction exists between SES and stage at diagnosis on mortality.

we shuold emphasize that  new non-parametric and parametric approaches, based on counterfactual framework, are now available to address some of the problems we describe herein, including the Mediation formula, inverse probability weighting, and g-formula (5, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34},

Effect modification can be present with no interaction; interaction can be present with no effect modification. There are settings in which it is possible to assess effect modification but not interaction, or to assess interaction but not effect modification. The analytic procedures for obtaining estimates of effect modification parameters and interaction parameters using marginal structural models are compared and contrasted.

@article{Neggers2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The influence of psychosocial factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem on birth weight is controversial. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial profile, and maternal health practices. METHODS: 3,149 low-income, predominantly African-American pregnant women participated in this study. A 28-item psychosocial scale measured the constructs of negative and positive affect, self esteem, mastery, worry, and stress. Maternal health practices were assessed with 11 questions dealing with diet, exercise, and the use of preventive medical and dental services. RESULTS: A low score on either scale indicated "poor" psychosocial or health practices status. Low birth weight, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth retardation occurred in 10.9, 10.1 and 7.3{\%} of the pregnant women respectively. In women with low psychosocial scores, the risk of both low birth weight and preterm delivery was 40{\%} higher and the mean birth weight of infants was 51 g (p =0.02) lower as compared to women with high scores. Negative affect (a measure of depression) was the only factor significantly associated with both infant birth weight (beta = -71.2, p =0.001) and low birth weight (AOR=1.4, 95{\%} CI = 1.1-1.7). When data were stratified by body mass index, the adverse effect of negative affect scores on birth weight and low birth weight was present only in thin women. Health practice scores were not associated with any of the pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Thin women with a poor psychosocial profile and who are depressed during pregnancy are at increased risk of giving birth to low birth weight and preterm infants.},

These assumptions are quite general and can easily be tested; they do not require pre-cise background knowledge of p(x) or p(w), such as proportions estimated from previous studies. We particularly consider conditional independence constraints, which often arise from graphical and causal models, although other constraints can also be used.

Assuming independence between exposure and genotype in the population, the authors believe that the case-only design is more efficient than a case-control design in detecting gene-environment interaction.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastroschisis, a birth defect characterized by herniated fetal abdominal wall, occurs more commonly in infants born to teenage and young mothers. Ischemia of the vascular vitelline vessels is the likely mechanism of pathogenesis. Given that chronic stress and violence against women are risk factors for cardiovascular disease we explored whether these may represent risk factors for gastroschisis, when they occur during pregnancy. A case-control study was conducted, with 15 incident cases of children born with gastroschisis in the Region of Murcia, Spain, from December 2007 to June 2013. Forty concurrent controls were recruited at gestation weeks 20-24 or post-partum. All mothers of cases and controls completed a comprehensive, in-person, 'green sheet' questionnaire on environmental exposures. RESULTS: Mothers of children with gastroschisis were younger, smoked more cigarettes per week relative to controls, were exposed to higher amounts of illegal drugs, and suffered from domestic violence more frequently than the controls. Multivariable logistic regression analysis highlights periconceptional 'gender-related violence' (OR: 16.6, 95{\%} CI 2.7 to 101.7) and younger maternal age (OR 1.1, 95{\%} CI 1.0-1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Violence against pregnant women is associated with birth defects, and should be studied in more depth as a cause-effect teratogenic. Psychosocial risk factors, including gender-based violence, are important for insuring the health and safety of the pregnant mother and the fetus.},

New findings on the genetics, the possible roles of the environment and the immune system, and intrinsic abnormalities in the endometrium of affected women and secreted products of endometriotic lesions have given insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder and serve as the background for new treatments for  disease-associated pain and infertility. Affected women are at higher risk than the general female population of developing ovarian cancer, and they also may be  at increased risk of breast and other cancers as well as autoimmune and atopic disorders. Clinicians should assess and follow up affected women for these and other associated disorders.

In addition to poverty, maternal dieting, teenage pregnancy, and uterine vascular problems in older mothers are causes of decreased fetal nutrition. We evaluated the impact of global 30{\%} maternal nutrient reduction (MNR) on early fetal baboon brain maturation. MNR induced major cerebral developmental disturbances without fetal growth restriction or marked maternal weight reduction. Mechanisms evaluated included neurotrophic factor suppression, cell proliferation and cell death imbalance, impaired glial maturation and neuronal process formation, down-regulation of gene ontological pathways and related gene products, and up-regulated transcription of cerebral catabolism. Contrary to the known benefits from this degree of dietary reduction on life span, MNR in pregnancy compromises structural fetal cerebral development, potentially having an impact on brain function throughout life.},

abstract = {Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) over 35 years ago, mounting evidence about the impact of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has prompted increased attention to the link between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a constellation of developmental disabilities that are characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. These disabilities include a continuum of developmental disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Longitudinal studies suggest that individuals with FASDs are at a greatly increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes, including mental health problems and poor social adjustment. This review summarizes the existing literature on mental health outcomes for individuals with PAE across the lifespan, including findings in infancy and early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence and early adulthood. Research on the psychiatric disabilities suffered by individuals with FASDs throughout development highlights the need for training of mental health professionals in the identification and the provision of specific treatments to address the unique features of this developmental disability since early identification and treatment have been demonstrated to be protective against more serious secondary disabilities. It is hoped that with greater awareness of the mental health problems experienced by individuals with FASDs, these individuals can receive appropriate and early treatment resulting in more adaptive and rewarding lives.},

abstract = {Identification of new molecular targets for the treatment of breast cancer is an important clinical goal, especially for triple-negative breast cancer, which is refractory to existing targeted treatments. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor known primarily as the mediator of dioxin toxicity. However, the AhR can also inhibit cellular proliferation in a ligand-dependent manner and act as a tumor suppressor in mice, and thus may be a potential anticancer target. To investigate the AhR as an anticancer target, we conducted a small molecule screen to discover novel AhR ligands with anticancer properties. We identified raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator currently used in the clinic for prevention of ER-positive breast cancer and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, as an AhR activator. Raloxifene directly bound the AhR and induced apoptosis in ER-negative mouse and human hepatoma cells in an AhR-dependent manner, indicating that the AhR is a molecular target of raloxifene and mediates raloxifene-induced apoptosis in the absence of ER. Raloxifene selectively induced apoptosis of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared with non-transformed mammary epithelial cells via the AhR. Combined with recent data showing that raloxifene inhibits triple-negative breast cancer xenografts in vivo (Int J Oncol. 43(3):785-92, 2013), our results support the possibility of repurposing of raloxifene as an AhR-targeted therapeutic for triple-negative breast cancer patients. To this end, we also evaluated the role of AhR expression on survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. We found that higher expression of the AhR is significantly associated with increased overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in both hormone-dependent (ER-positive) and hormone-independent (ER and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative) breast cancers. Together, our data strongly support the possibility of using the AhR as a molecular target for the treatment of hormone-independent breast cancers.},

abstract = {AIM/DESIGN Many epidemiological studies published on the association between maternal cocaine/crack use and birth weight have either lacked precision or failed to control for major confounding, predominantly by tobacco smoking. Meta-analysis enables a single summary measure of effect to be calculated by combining data from any number of individual studies, thus enhancing statistical power. We undertook a number of meta-analyses using only studies that had adjusted for tobacco smoking to estimate more precisely the effect of maternal cocaine use on birth weight. FINDINGS A meta-analysis of five studies presenting data for 'any' prenatal cocaine exposure, adjusted for tobacco smoking but unadjusted for gestational age, produced a pooled relative risk estimate from a fixed effects analysis of 2.15 (95{\%} CI 1.75-2.64). However, there was substantial heterogeneity among studies (p {\textless} 0.001), and the relative risk from a random effects analysis was smaller (1.65) with a confidence interval that included unity (95{\%} CI 0.94-2.83). Addition of a further study adjusted for gestational age had minimal effect on the pooled estimate: the fixed effects relative risk was 2.14 (1.77-2.60) and the random effects estimate 1.77 (1.15-2.71). When data on more intense prenatal exposure were analysed, the fixed and random effects analysis produced the same pooled estimate of the relative risk of 4.42 (2.24-8.71), suggesting that more frequent cocaine exposure was associated with a higher relative risk for low birth weight. Data from studies on mean reduction in birth weight produced a pooled estimate of 112 g (95{\%} CI 62-161 g). CONCLUSIONS The current study suggests that maternal cocaine use causes low birth weight, and that the effect is greater with heavier use. However, despite the adjustment for tobacco and the adjustment by some studies for other confounders such as race, maternal age, gravidity and socio-economic status, it could be argued that other life-style factors not controlled for may account for the observed effects. While this argument is not supported by some other types of study, the issue of residual confounding can only be finally addressed by analytical studies which adequately control for important variables.},

We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be utilized in practice.},

Two hundred and three of 1,452 young adults surveyed (14{\%}) reported witnessing as children at least one incident of physical aggression between their parents. Both men and women who witnessed interparental physical conflict reported higher levels of current psychological distress than a comparison group of young adults who never observed physical aggression between their parents. This group difference remained even after controlling for parental divorce, parental SES, physical abuse of the child, parental alcoholism, and nonphysical discord witnessed between parents. Additional analyses found that the negative effect of witnessing interparental aggression was intensified when the aggression was serious enough to warrant some type of outside assistance for the victim and when the parent of the same-sex was seen being victimized. Although these findings provided support for the theory that witnessing interparental physical aggression is a traumatic experience that may have long-term psychological ramifications, we also found that a substantial proportion of the variance accounted for in adult adjustment by interparental physical conflict was mediated through decreased parental caring and warmth during childhood. Implications for these results, limitations of the present study, and directions for further research are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies testing whether systemic inflammation might lie on the causal pathway between aberrant fetal and post-natal growth patterns and later cardiovascular disease have been inconclusive, possibly due to the use of single markers of unknown predictive value. We used repeated measures of a comprehensive set of inflammatory markers to investigate the relationship between early life measures and systemic inflammation in an African population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Individuals born in three rural villages in The Gambia, and for whom early life measurements were recorded, were traced (n = 320). Fasting levels of eight inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, orosomucoid, fibrinogen, $\alpha$ 1-antichymotrypsin, sialic acid, interleukin-6 and neopterin) were measured, and potential confounding factors recorded. The association between early life measurements and systemic inflammation was assessed using regression analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Levels of most markers were unrelated to early growth patterns. In analyses adjusted for age and sex, more rapid growth between birth and 3 months of age was associated with higher levels of fibrinogen, orosomucoid, and sialic acid. These relationships persisted after further adjustment for body mass index but after full adjustment only the association with fibrinogen remained.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides little evidence that size at birth or growth in early infancy determine levels of inflammatory markers in young Gambian adults.},

abstract = {Objectives: $\backslash$nTo present national population-based estimates of the prevalence of parent-reported emotional and/or behavioral problems in children with asthma and the relationship of medical comorbidity and asthma severity with behavior problems.Design:$\backslash$nCross-sectional study of the 1988 National Health Interview on Child Health.Main Outcome Measures:$\backslash$nParent responses to a checklist of child health conditions were used to assign school-age children (5 to 17 years old) into one of four groups: children without reported chronic conditions; children with asthma alone; children with asthma and additional reported chronic conditions; and children with the same chronic conditions, but without asthma. Parental responses to the Behavior Problem Index (BPI) were used for construction of an overall BPI score, as well as subscale scores. Crosstabulation and linear and logistic regression were used to determine the relation of the different condition categories to emotional and/or behavioral problems expressed by relative values of the BPI.Results:$\backslash$nChildren with asthma and comorbid conditions had a mean BPI score of 7.3, compared with 5.4 for children without chronic conditions, and all subscale scores, except those for antisocial antisocial conduct and immature behavior, were significantly elevated. Using logistic regression to control for confounding variables, children with severe asthma alone had nearly three times the odds (odds ratio, 2.96; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.22 to 7.17) and children with asthma plus comorbid conditions nearly twice the odds (odds ratio, 1.86; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.90) of children without chronic conditions to have severe behavior problems.Conclusions:$\backslash$nSevere asthma and asthma with medical comorbidity represent significant risk factors for emotional and/or behavioral problems. Clinicians caring for children with asthma and their families should be aware of the relationship between asthma and emotional and/or behavioral problems and anticipate that a substantial number of their patients may have mental health services needs.(Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1995;149:565-572)},

abstract = {We have developed a methodology for comparing the seasonal influences on two outcomes, when those influences may act cumulatively or instantaneously. We have used this to compare the seasonal pattern of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR, as reflected by weight-for-gestational-age) and preterm delivery (as assessed by Dubowitz scoring) among 1718 infants born in rural Gambia. Both outcomes were analysed as binary variables: small-for-gestational-age (SGA, {\textless}10th centile of reference standard) and preterm ({\textless}37 weeks) respectively. Percentages of preterm and SGA babies show divergent seasonal patterns that might indicate separate aetiologies. However, seasonal effects influencing intrauterine growth are likely to be cumulative over the last few months of pregnancy. By modelling seasonality with truncated Fourier series we were able to deconvolve the underlying seasonal influences on fetal growth from the pattern for SGA. This enabled us to use seemingly unrelated biprobit regression to compare the underlying seasonal pattern of intrauterine growth with that governing the incidence of preterm delivery. We conclude that, if the seasonal factors affecting intrauterine growth operate over more than the last 2 months of pregnancy, then the seasonal patterns of the factors causing IUGR and preterm delivery are indistinguishable if the factors are assumed to trigger preterm delivery immediately, but differ if preterm delivery is assumed to be programmed by factors acting at conception.},

abstract = {To present the prevalence and urban-rural differences of overweight and obesity in 7-9-year-old Swedish schoolchildren, we used anthropometric data from a nationally representative survey performed in 2008. Trained staff weighed and measured 4538 children in grades 1 and 2 in 94 primary schools. Weight classification was performed using the IOTF reference and school areas were classified based on level of urbanization and area-level education. Overweight was found in 17{\%} of the children including 3{\%} obese. For overweight, odds-ratios were 1.33 and 1.61 (significant) in semi-urban and rural areas, relative to urban areas. After adjusting for area-level education, differences by degree of urbanisation were greatly attenuated and non-significant. For obesity urban-rural differences were observed in boys only and remained after adjustment for area-level education. For area-level education, risk estimates were significantly elevated and unaffected by urbanization and gender, odds-ratios 1.75 and 2.21 for overweight and 2.62 and 3.69 for obesity, in medium- and low-education areas compared to high-education areas. This supports earlier reports identifying areas with low socioeconomic status as high-risk areas for overweight and obesity. However, this study also suggests that gender should be considered when targeting children in urban as well as rural communities for health promoting interventions.},

abstract = {Seasonal patterns of birthrates and birthweights have been compiled from the delivery records of 11 rural hospitals and compared with each other and with the local rainfall pattern by means of lagged regression analysis. While mean birthweight is lower in high rainfall areas, both magnitude and predictability of seasonal birthweight variations are greater in low rainfall areas. Such differences are attributed to different combinations of infection rates, dietary intake and reliability of food supply. Seasonal variations in birthrate were found to occur independently from those of birthweight. Birth seasonality was found to be prominent only in areas with holoendemic malaria and is attributed to a seasonal depression of fecundity mainly due to malaria infection.},

@article{Wacholder1992a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To assist in elucidating principles underlying the design of injury case-control studies.APPROACH: We begin by defining "event" as the sequence of circumstances that place a person at risk of injury (e.g. bicycle crash) and "injury given the event" as the resultant physical damage (e.g. head injury in bicycle crash). We then identify two broad classes of research question: 1) Studies of risk factors for the event, and, 2) Studies of risk factors for injury given the event. The study base for the first type of research question is all persons at risk of the event, while the study base for the second type is all persons who experience the event, and are therefore at risk of injury. It follows that in studies of risk factors for injury given the event, the controls should be a sample of all persons who experience the event. For example, in a study of bicycle helmets and head injuries, a suitable case group would be cyclists treated for head injury following a bicycle crash. The appropriate control group is drawn from the base population of all cyclists who crashed, including those who had no injuries. The control group may be restricted to cyclists who crashed and sought treatment for non-head injury under the assumption that the exposure distribution (prevalence of cycle helmet use) in the crash/no injury group is identical to the exposure distribution in the crash/non-head injury group.CONCLUSIONS: It is over ten years since innovative researchers in Seattle first applied the case-control design to the problem of bicycle crashes. Since then, successive bicycle injury studies at other centers have largely failed to extend and refine the Seattle methodology. A more critical approach to the design of case-control studies is required if we are to continue to advance the field of injury epidemiology.},

abstract = {Environmental agents including ethanol, 13-cis retinoic acid (RA, Accutane), the antimetabolite methotrexate, periods of hypoxia, ionizing radiation or hyperthermic stress, when administered acutely to pregnant experimental animals, induce stage-dependent craniofacial malformations comparable to those in corresponding human teratogen syndromes. Acute treatment regimens have allowed analysis of cell populations initially affected and subsequent dysmorphogenetic sequences as well as speculation relative to mechanisms of teratogenesis. In rodent models, ethanol and RA appear to affect similar cell populations and comparable malformations can be induced by both agents. When administered during gastrulation they cause a major insult to the anterior neural plate which results in characteristic ocular, brain and facial malformations comparable to those seen in the fetal alcohol syndrome. Exposure to these drugs at a time just prior to and during neural crest cell migration into the craniofacial and cervical regions results in malformations comparable to those seen in the Di-George sequence and/or retinoic acid embryopathy. Slightly later, at the time that the epibranchial placodes are active, insult results in mandibulofacial dysostosis-like syndromes. We propose that the pattern of these malformations is related to the particular vulnerability of cells in the vicinity of normal programmed cell death. Cell death is also associated with ionizing radiation and hyperthermia-induced malformations. Both of these teratogens are particularly damaging to the early development of the eye and central nervous system. Teratogenic temperature elevations result in arrest of mitotic activity and death of cells in mitosis. Hypoxia is also associated with cell death in specific regions and subsequent malformation. For example, death of cells in the invaginating olfactory placode has recently been associated with cleft lip formation. The relationship of hypoxia-induced cell death to energy requirements is being explored. Acute treatment with methotrexate results in frontonasal dysplasia (median facial clefts). Combined effects of fluid imbalance, lack of proliferation or death of frontonasal mesenchyme appear to be involved. Although the mechanisms of craniofacial malformation are complex, a common feature for many is excessive cell death for which the embryo may be unable to compensate. Excessive cell death in regions of programmed cell death represents an important, yet little appreciated, mechanism of teratogenesis.},

Current day and daily lagged associa-tions between PM10 levels and PEF were observed. Elevated levels of PMlO pollution also were as-sociated with increases In reported symptoms of respiratory disease and use of asthma medication. Associations between compromised respiratory health and elevated PM lO pollution were observed even when PM,olevels were well below the 24-h national ambient air quality standard of 150 {\~{}}g/m3. Associations between elevated PM,olevels, reductions In PEF, and increases In symptoms of respi-ratory disease and asthma medication use remained statistically significant even when the only pollution episode that exceeded the standard was excluded.

abstract = {The transcriptional regulators aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) modulate the transcription of genes involved in cellular differentiation and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the expression of these transcriptional regulators in the female reproductive tract. AHR and ARNT mRNA transcripts were readily detected by a ribonuclease protection assay in all reproductive tissues examined. The expression of these factors in the endometrium and myometrium did not vary during the menstrual cycle, and was not different in pre- versus post-menopausal women. However, post-menopausal women on continuous hormone replacement therapy had greater expression of AHR but not of ARNT in the endometrium and myometrium when compared with women not taking hormones. Leiomyomas expressed significantly less AHR and ARNT mRNA compared with normal myometrium. The ovaries expressed both AHR and ARNT mRNA, and expression was unaffected by age. Endometriotic ovarian cysts expressed more AHR but not more ARNT mRNA compared with healthy ovarian tissue. However, there were no changes in the expression of AHR or ARNT mRNA in ovarian cancer. In conclusion, the female reproductive tract expresses mRNA for the transcription factors AHR and ARNT, and changes in their expression at select target sites in specific pathological conditions such as endometriosis and uterine leiomyomas suggest a potential role for these factors in the pathogenesis of these conditions.},

abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor which requires heterodimerization with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) for function. Arnt is also a dimerization partner of the hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) for the hypoxia signaling. Additionally, Arnt is found to be a potent coactivator of the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. Thus we examined whether the presence of an increased amount of AhR may suppress both the HIF-1alpha and ER signaling pathways by sequestering Arnt. We tested our hypothesis using a human AhR construct C Delta553 which is capable of heterodimerizing with Arnt in the absence of a ligand. Transient transfection studies using a corresponding luciferase reporter plasmid in MCF-7 cells showed that C Delta553 effectively suppressed the AhR, HIF-1alpha, and ER signaling pathways. Reverse transcription/real-time QPCR data showed that C Delta553 blocked the up-regulation of the target genes controlled by AhR (CYP1A1), HIF-1alpha (VEGF, aldolase C, and LDH-A), and ER (GREB1, pS2, and c-myc) in MCF-7 cells. Since both HIF-1alpha and ER are highly active in the ER-positive breast cancer, C Delta553 has the potential to be developed as a protein drug to treat breast cancer by blocking these two signaling pathways.},

We aimed to estimate the proportion of all fetuses with birth defects terminated in the second trimester of pregnancy-overall and for specific defects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The study comprised all pregnancies ending in a singleton birth, miscarriage, or termination of pregnancy for which health care services were sought, as recorded in Danish medical registries between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 420,090 pregnancies, 307,637 fetuses survived until gestational week 12 or beyond; of these, 296,373 (96{\%}) ended in a live birth or stillbirth and 11,264 (4{\%}) ended in a second-trimester termination. The prevalence of birth defects among live births and stillbirths was 3{\%} (9,790/296,373); the corresponding prevalence among second-trimester-terminated pregnancies was 14{\%} (1,563/11,264). Although only 4{\%} of all pregnancies ended in a second-trimester termination, 14{\%} (1,563/11,353) of pregnancies with birth defects were ended by a second-trimester termination. The groups of birth defects with the highest proportion of second-trimester terminations were defects of the nervous system (347/740; 48{\%}) and abdominal wall (58/149; 39{\%}). For many types of birth defects, however, that proportion was less than 10{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The proportion of terminated pregnancies carrying birth defects is considerably greater than the corresponding proportion for pregnancies that end as live births or stillbirths. The proportion of birth defects unobserved at birth due to second-trimester terminations depends on type of defect and lethality.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years, the field of substance use among American Indian adolescents has come to be dominated by survey approaches that are unable to answer important questions about how the use of alcohol and drugs is conceptualized and meaningfully integrated in the lives of Indian teens. Without a model of adolescent alcohol use that incorporates culture, the field misapprehends the social and cultural grounding of both normal and pathological drinking, and cannot accurately differentiate between normal and pathological drinking. Traditionally, the field has relied upon either a biological model or a distress model, thus locating pathology in the biochemistry of ethanol ingestion or in psychopathological distress. However, findings from an ethnographic investigation of alcohol use among American Indian adolescents suggest that the criteria for distinguishing pathological drinking lie, instead, in the developmental and gender-specific expectations that derive from cultural values. Specifically, at a Northern Plains site, teen drinking is judged by whether drinking has begun to interfere with developmental tasks relating to the cultural values of courage, modesty, humor, generosity and family honor. We conclude with suggestions for clinicians and researchers that offer the potential to facilitate the incorporation of culture into research and practice in the field of American Indian adolescent alcohol use},

"Today the field is dominated by survey-based and epidemiological studies. While offering more and more robust findings about the high rates of alcohol and drug use among American Indian adolescents, such approaches are unable to answer important questions about how substance use is conceptualized and meaningfully integrated in the lives of INdian teens."


"the field cases teens as 'distressed actors,' whose patterns of drinking reflect a pan-human 'tension-reducing' response of the individual to stress and distress; peripheral to this model is cultural variation in the definitions of normal and pathological use of alcohol."

"Reviewing accounts which explicitly address the role of culture in alcohol use and abuse reveals that neither the 'biological' nor the 'distress' models are sufficient explanations for American Indian teen drinking."

"in ethnographic accounts, drinking habits frequently seem to reveal more about an individual's social location within a culturally defined context that they do about his or her psychological motivations."

"The parallels with the drinking behaviors of Euroamerican college students are clear. To describe any of these young persons as engaging in predominantly psychologically motivated behavior, rather than in conventional social-role behavior, would be to fundamentally misconstrue the nature of normal and pathological alcohol use."

"The unwarranted pathologization of American Indian adolescents, and their societies more generally, is a potential danger that inheres in the naive application of Euroamerican judgements to American Indian drinking."

"However, if not all teen drinking is pathological, where are we to locate the line between normal and problem teen drinking?"},

"The BPI was created by Zill and Peterson (26) to measure the frequency, range, and type of childhood behavior problems for children ages 4 years and older. Many items were derived from the Achenback Child Behavior Checklist (27). Mothers could answer "often", "sometimes true", or "not true" to each item. Responses were dichotomized into "often or sometimes true" or "not true" bythe NLSY. Externalizing and Interalizing standardscores were created by the NLSY on the basis of the trichotomous "often", "sometimes true", or "not true" rating. Norms for externalizing and internalizing standard scores are age based but not sex based. Some questions in the BPI contribute to both the internalizing and the externalizing subscore. The BPI is also divided into 6 subscalse: antisocial, anxious/depressed, dependent, headstrong, hyperactive, and peer conflicts/withdrawn.The specific questions included in teh BPI are provided in Table 2... We categrized total BPI standard scores as clinicallymeaningful when they were {\textgreater}90th percentile for the entire cohort of 8-11 year old children n the NLSY in 1996 and in 1998. We selected this cutoff on the basis of previous data indicating that BPI scores at this level are associated with higher rates of referrals for mental health services (9). The {\textgreater}90th percentile cutoff was also used to categorize internalizing and externalizing standard scores as clinically meaningful."

Much less, however, is known about factors that may influence women to gain weight within currently recommended ranges. The importance of this issue is suggested by recent reports indicating that only 30-40{\%} of women actually gain weight within these ranges. This paper examines demographic, sociocultural, and behavioral factors that are associated with, and may influence risk of, low prenatal weight gain among adult women with low and normal body mass indexes. Available data suggest that these factors include ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, education, pregnancy intendedness or wantedness, prenatal advice, and psychosocial characteristics such as attitude toward weight gain, social support, depression, stress, anxiety, and self-efficacy. Potential theoretical models for these associations include biological, behavioral, and mixed pathways. The design of targeted intervention studies will depend on further identification and characterization of sociocultural and behavioral risk factors that, along with reproductive and nutritional characteristics, may predict which women are most likely to have inadequate prenatal weight gain.},

The potential role of selection bias in explaining such heterogeneity is considered within this study. Selection bias according to familial characteristics and socioeconomic status is investigated within a United Kingdom-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed during 1998-2001. Reported distributions of birth order and maternal age are each compared with expected reference distributions derived using national birth statistics from the United Kingdom. A method is detailed in which yearly data are used to derive expected distributions, taking account of variability in birth statistics over time. Census data are used to reweight both the case and control study populations such that they are comparable with the general population with regard to socioeconomic status. The authors found little support for an association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and birth order or family size and little evidence for an influence of selection bias. However, the findings suggest that between-study heterogeneity could be explained by selection biases that influence the demographic characteristics of participants.},

'The major determinant for the occurrence of FAS is poverty... Poverty, not genotype, provides the kind of host environment that exacerbates alcohol's toxic actions."

"Although twin studies indicate genotype can be a factor in susceptibility to FAS, it is individual differences in genotypes rather than population differences that seem to be involved. This, in turn, suggests that population studies comparing racial genotypes for rates of alcohol metabolism or susceptibilities to alcoholism will be less fruitful in preventing FAS than studies which identify the socioeconomic risk factors contributing to FAS."

"low SES and heavy alcohol consumption are both associated with smoking, poor nutrition, poor health, increased stress, and use of other drugs (refs). Whereas none of these individual factors gives rise to FAS themselves, it is possible, if not likeley, that they exacerbate the effects of heavy alcohol intake."},

abstract = {Causal effects are defined as comparisons of potential outcomes under different treatments on a common set of units. Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism—a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on s...},

'Five outcome variables were used. Three of these are subscales of a behavior problems index that was adaptedfrom a longer checklist developed by Achenbach and Edelbrock (1981) to preidct mental and behavior problems that may require therapy. We used three critera to select items from the checklist: reliability; high loading on one of the subscales that emerged from their analyses, and adaptability to an interview situation. Factor analysis of the items in the National Survey of Children yielded four factors, similar to ones found in Achenbach's work. Three of the four factors appear to represent fairly serious behavior problems. These are depressed/withdraw behavior, antisocial behavior, and impulsive/hyperactive behavior. Each of these subscales is composed of six items. (The fourth factor, measuring milder and more general behavior problems, is not used in this analysis).

While factor analysis was used to confirm which items belonged together in a subscale, a simple additive index was used to create each scale. This was done so that the scale score would have a straighforward meaning: namely, the number of items (from 0 to 6) that the parent reported as characterizing the child."

Am J Epidemiol 1992;135:1029-50). In this paper, a theoretical framework for selecting controls in case-control studies is developed. Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

We compared 101 children exposed prenatally to cocaine with 130 unexposed children on measures of intelligence, visual motor, and motor abilities at age 7 years. Bivariate analyses revealed that cocaine-exposed children scored significantly lower than comparison children on the abbreviated Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition Verbal and Full Scale IQ scores, the Visual Motor Integration and Motor Coordination standardized scores, and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Fine Motor Composite score. Regression analyses indicated that the biological mother's vocabulary and home environment assessed at the same 7-year visit were stronger predictors of developmental outcome than prenatal drug exposure. Level of cocaine exposure, however, predicted visual motor and motor skills. The results indicate that although prenatal cocaine exposure may confer some degree of developmental disadvantage in the visual motor domain, it frequently occurs in the context of an inadequate rearing environment, which may be a stronger determinant than prenatal cocaine exposure of children's outcome.},

HOME and caregiver cognitive scores mores frequently correlated with outcomes

"Because effects on the outcomes were small in the present study, partialing them out across multiple drugs would obscure the overall finding that, in general, children with poorer home environments and whose mothers have poorer vocabularies are performing poorly across all developmental outcomes. The clinical and policy implications from this study are clear. To lessen biological risks and enhance development, prenatal programs that provide drug treatment to women, especially in disadvantaged families, should, in addition to treating drug use, include interventions designed to improve both the mothers' academic and caregiving skills."},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine household out-of-pocket expenditure on health care, particularly malaria treatment, in rural Burkina Faso. METHOD: Comprehensive analysis of out-of-pocket expenditure on health care through a descriptive analysis and a second, multivariate analysis using the Tobit model with emphasis on malaria, based on 800 urban and rural households in Nouna health district. RESULTS: Households will spend less on malaria, either in or outside the health facility, if given the choice to do so, because they feel confident to self-treat malaria. Seeking health care from a qualified health worker incurs more out-of-pocket expenditure than self-treatment and traditional healers, and if necessary, households sell off assets to offset the expenditure. More than 80{\%} of household out-of-pocket expenditure is allocated to drugs. CONCLUSION: This has policy implications for malaria control and the Roll Back Malaria Initiative. Communities need to be educated on the risks of malaria complications and the potential risk of inappropriate diagnosis and treatment. Drug or health services pricing policy needs to create an incentive to use the health services. In the fight against malaria, building alliances between households, traditional healers and health workers is essential.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Occupational exposure to endotoxin, found in Gram-negative bacteria in organic material, has been associated predominantly with a reduced risk of lung cancer among workers. An inverse exposure-response gradient among women textile workers in Shanghai, China, has been reported previously. In this case-cohort study, we investigated the influence of left truncation, which can itself induce a downward trend, on the observed association. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled between 1989 and 1991 and followed until 1998. The data were left-truncated as all subjects were hired before baseline. An analysis was performed with 3038 subcohort members and 602 cases of incident lung cancer. To evaluate left truncation, we compared lung cancer rates in those hired longer ago with those hired more recently among unexposed subjects. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate incident rate ratios (IRRs) and 95{\%} CIs. RESULTS: Among those who were never exposed to workplace endotoxin, we compared lung cancer rates in those hired {\textgreater}35 years before enrolment with workers hired ≤35 years before enrolment and observed a reduced risk in the former group, IRR=0.74, 95{\%} CI (0.51 to 1.07). After accounting for this downward bias from left truncation, the reduced risk associated with endotoxin remained among those hired ≤50 years before enrolment. In contrast, there was suggestion of an increased risk of lung cancer among those hired {\textgreater}50 years ago. CONCLUSIONS: After examination of left truncation bias, an inverse dose-response between endotoxin and lung cancer remained for all subjects except those hired longest ago.},

configural invariance (Vandenberg {\&} Lance, 200)

"Measurement invariance refers to the notion that an assessment instrument measures the same construct across populations. In addition to configural invariance, other components of measurement invariance include metric invariance (similarity of factor loadings), scalar invariance (similarity of item intercepts), residual invariance (similarity of item residuals), factor variance invariance (similarity of factor covariances), and latent mean invariance (similarity of latent means)."

"The WLSMV (Muthen {\&} Muthen, 2004) estimator represents a significant advance in CFA of data such as ratings on the CBCL. Because it is an asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) estimator, the WLSMV can be used with ordinal data without assuming multivariate normality. This is extremely important in CFA of problem ratings because problem item distributions are usually non-normal, which limits the utility of estimation procedures that assume multivariate normality. In addition to being robust to violations of multivariate normality, the WLSMV estimator is extremely efficient in comparison to other ADF estimators, such as the ULS (unweighted least squares)."

Results from the new national monitoring network for PM2.5 make possible systematic research on health risks at national and regional scales. OBJECTIVES: To estimate risks of cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5 for Medicare enrollees and to explore heterogeneity of the variation of risks across regions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national database comprising daily time-series data daily for 1999 through 2002 on hospital admission rates (constructed from the Medicare National Claims History Files) for cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and injuries, ambient PM2.5 levels, and temperature and dew-point temperature for 204 US urban counties (population {\textgreater}200,000) with 11.5 million Medicare enrollees (aged {\textgreater}65 years) living an average of 5.9 miles from a PM2.5 monitor. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily counts of county-wide hospital admissions for primary diagnosis of cerebrovascular, peripheral, and ischemic heart diseases, heart rhythm, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and respiratory infection, and injuries as a control outcome. RESULTS: There was a short-term increase in hospital admission rates associated with PM2.5 for all of the health outcomes except injuries. The largest association was for heart failure, which had a 1.28{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.78{\%}-1.78{\%}) increase in risk per 10-microg/m3 increase in same-day PM2.5. Cardiovascular risks tended to be higher in counties located in the Eastern region of the United States, which included the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest, and the South. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.},

abstract = {Since its discovery almost 30 years ago, the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been characterized in the USA, as a major threat to public health. In part because FAS resonated with broader social concerns in the 1970s and 1980s about alcohol's deleterious effect on American society and about a perceived increase in child abuse and neglect, it quickly achieved prominence as a social problem. In this paper, we demonstrate that, as concern about this social problem escalated beyond the level warranted by the existing evidence, FAS took on the status of a moral panic. Through examples taken from both the biomedical literature and the media about drinking during pregnancy, we illustrate the evolution of this development, and we describe its implications, particularly how it has contributed to a vapid public policy response.},

dichotomous coding

Total and subscale summed scores

"In addition to investigating the relationship between maternal smoking and mean subscale and overall BPI scores, we also derived a dichotomous varialbe that identified subjects with extreme behavior problem scores. The cutoff for this category was a score of 14 or more behavior problems ("sometimes" or "often" responses) on the BPI. In a previous study using a nationally representative sample, this score represented the approximate top 10th percentile of BPI scores, and this cutoff was substantially related to whether subjects had been referred to mental health professionals" (36)

"The properties of the BPI's overall score and subscales have been investigated and have been shown to be satisfactory via factor analyses of the items using prinicpal components analyses followed by a principal components analysis with varimax rotation as reported by N. Zill (written communication, 1985). Estimates of internal consistency reliability of the scales have been made using coefficient alpha. The total BPI had an estimated reliability of 0.90 and reliability averaged 0.70 across the subscales (36). Missing values for individual BPI items were few in number and were imputed."},

This paper highlights several graphical and algebraic methods capable of mitigating and sometimes eliminating this bias. These non-parametric methods generalize previously re-ported results, and identify the type of knowl-edge that is needed for reasoning in the pres-ence of selection bias. Specifically, we derive a general condition together with a procedure for deciding recoverability of the odds ratio (OR) from s-biased data. We show that re-coverability is feasible if and only if our condi-tion holds. We further offer a new method of controlling selection bias using instrumental variables that permits the recovery of other effect measures besides OR.},

IV assumptions have been well described: (1) IV affects E; (2) IV affects Y only through E; (3) IV shares no common cause with Y. Even when these assumptions are met, biased effect estimates can result if selection bias allows a noncausal path from E to Y. We demonstrate the presence of bias in IV analyses on a sample from a simulated dataset, where selection into the sample was a collider on a noncausal path from E to Y. By applying inverse probability of selection weights, we were able to eliminate the selection bias. IV approaches may protect against unmeasured confounding but are not immune from selection bias. Inverse probability of selection weights used with IV approaches can minimize bias.},

abstract = {Studies have examined the association between birth weight and intelligence, with the understanding that these are both related to a family's socioeconomic status. In sibling studies, the association between family socioeconomic position and intelligence is strong. Several studies have reported a lower mean intelligence score for those with the highest birth weights. The present sibling design study was performed to examine the apparent lower intellectual performance of those with birth weights in the highest range. Confounders were birth order, family socioeconomic position, or shared but unidentified family factors., The study population included all Norwegian male singletons (N = 242,771) born at term between 1967 and 1976 and later conscripted into the military. After exclusions, the study population included 217,746 men. Siblings were identified using the mother's identity. Two subset populations were categorized; the sibling subset included 137,574 men (of 104,893 mothers) with at least 1 sibling, and the fraternal population included 62,906 men who had at least 1 brother born at term. Participants were examined between 1984 and 2003, when 98.3{\%} were aged 18 to 19 years. The intellectual performance test included 3 timed components: arithmetic, word similarities, and figures. These test results are highly correlated with IQ scores based on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence. To aid interpretation, the stanine test scores were transformed to an IQ scale with a mean of 100 and an SD of 15. Birth weight was classified into 8 levels with less than 2000 g the lowest and 5000 g or greater the highest. Birth weights of 4500 g or greater were considered macrosomic. Covariates included birth, maternal, and paternal factors. Primary analyses examined the association between birth weight, particularly macrosomia, and intelligence using a birth weight of 4000 to 4499 g as the reference., The mean birth weight was 3595 +/- 490 g, and the mean IQ score was 101.7 +/- 13.7 in the total study population. Mean IQ scores increased steadily from the lowest birth weight, reaching a peak value at 4000 to 4499 g, and declining in the 2 highest weight categories. The crude [beta] coefficient for birth weights of 5000 g or greater was -1.2 (95{\%} confidence interval, -2.2 to -0.3) compared with the reference weight. In the total population, 7826 births (3.6{\%}) were macrosomic, and 6832 (4.9{\%}) of the 137,574 sibling subset had sibship macrosomia. Mean differences in IQ scores were much larger for parental education level and somewhat larger for birth order than for birth weight. Other covariates were more weakly associated with IQ score. Sibship macrosomia, parental education, and birth order confounded the exposure-outcome association, and macrosomic men with birth injury or asphyxia had low mean IQ scores. The differences seen leveled off for birth weights of 4500 g or greater in the multivariable analysis, because of the influence of birth order and parental education. Including participants with injury or asphyxia in the analysis did not substantially alter associations between birth weight and IQ score., The majority of the association between high birth weight and low IQ score was caused by confounding from shared family factors. Participants from families with a tendency to have macrosomic babies had, on average, lower IQ scores than did other participants; however, men with higher birth weights tended to have higher IQ scores. Future research should attempt to identify the shared family factors contributing to the association. The creation of large prospective birth cohorts with sibling designs and application of multilevel analysis is necessary., Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

In addition to the short-term complications of obesity during pregnancy in both mother and child, it is now recognised that maternal obesity has long-term adverse outcomes for the health of her offspring in later life. Evidence from both animal and human studies indicates that maternal obesity increases the risk for the offspring in developing obesity and altering body composition in child- and adulthood and, additionally, it also has an impact on the offspring's cardiometabolic health with dysregulation of metabolism including glucose/insulin homoeostasis, and development of hypertension and vascular dysfunction. Potential mechanisms include effects on the development and function of adipose tissue, pancreas, muscle, liver, the vasculature and the brain. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the programming of disease risk in the offspring as a consequence of maternal obesity. The ultimate aim is to identify potential targets, which may be amenable to prevention or early intervention in order to improve the health of this and future generations.},

Recent data suggest that maternal obesity impairs oocyte quality in rodents and is associated with impaired development of the early embryo, so taht programming effects in the offspring could occur as a consequence of maternal obesity even before fertilisation (Minge et all 2008)"

"increased intramuscular fat accumulation and altered gene expression may be important in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in these models; indeed, offspring of obese mice demonstrate alterations in insulin signallinga nd mitochondrial complex activity in muscle in early adulthood (Shelley et al. 2009)"

"Programming effects on the brain may be of particular importance in mediating the effects of maternal obesity on offspring appetite and activity. The offspring of mice maintained on a highly palatable diet during both pregnancy and lactation demonstrate hyperphagia before the development of obesity (samuelsson et al. 2008), and rats exposed to a 'junk food' diet during both pregnancy and lactation themselves develop an exaggerated preference for fatty, sugary, and salty foods when compared to control animals (Bayol 2007). Such effects may reflect programmed changes in the hypothalamus, which has a pivotal role in the regulation of appetite and food intake (McMillen et al., 2005, Taylor and Poston 2007)." -- high calorie diets udring both pregnancy and lactation

"impact of overfeeding in the early postnatal period in the programming of the hypothalamus is well known (Davidowa and Plagemann 2000, Li et al 2002)"

"found altered expression of orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus of foetuses, suggesting that prenatal exposure to increased nutrition may be sufficient to programme alterations in the brain which may impact on appetite control"

"Alterations in adipose gene expression may be detected from early development, for example maternal obesity is associated with altered expression of genes in the adipose tissue of foetal sheep"

"A number of studies have demonstrated a link between maternal gestational weight gain and later obesity in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, while otheres have shown no effect. In these studies, the strength of the effect is generally less than that of maternal obesity per se, and there is some evidence that the effect is stronger among underweight/normal-weight women"

HFD offspring had less brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus than ND offspring. BDNF has been shown to play curcial roles in neuronal differentiation, plasticity and hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions such as spatial learning and memory."

"HFD offspring showed impaired acquisition of spatial learning in the young but not adult period"

learning/cognitive deficits in obese people "may be related to the effects of these diets on the down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus"

"BDNF plays an important role in the survival, maintenance and differentiation of many types of neurons and is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus. Accumulated evidence has also linked reductions in BDNF levels to interference with long-term potentiation (LTP) and neurogenesis. Interestingly, recent work as demonstrated that newborn neurons can contribute to hippocampal function, and this could be a cellular mechanism for learning and memory."

free radicals, oxidative stress

"These results indicate that decreased hippocampal BDNF production in the HFD offspring was not due to increases in stress hormones"

"At dat P35, GFP+ neurons from HFD offspring showed a reduced total dendritic length compared with that from ND offspring. Additionally, at day P35, HFD offspring displayed fewer dendritic branches than the ND offspring." also less complex dentrites

no differences in day P84

hippocampus-dependent cognition

4 weeks; Barnes circular maze test "Acquisition trial tests revealed that the latency to reach the correct hole above the escape box, and the distance covered to reach the target hole, were significantly longer in HFD offspring than in ND offspring; at 10 weeks, higher locomotor activity scores, no other differences

"These results indicate that maternal obesity impairs the acquisition of spatial memory in young offspring."

"Our recent report indicated that diet-induced maternal obesity decreased hippocampal neurogenesis in postnatal offspring (Tozuka et al 2009a)"

"In young animals from obese dams, the lipid peroxidation rate was elevated in the hippocampus, suggesting that the reduced BDNF was due to oxidative stress."

"glucocorticoids suppress BDNF expression in the hippocampus. Furthermore, it has been reported that HFD-induced obese animals and diabetic animals show hyperactive hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical function, resulting in elevated levels of circulating glucocorticoids. However, interestingly, our data showed no difference in the basal levels of serum corticosterone and its receptor between ND and HFD dams. Stranahan et al reported that HFD-fed obese animals showed lower hippocampal BDNF levels, with now change in serum corticosterone. These findings suggest that the reduction in hippocampal BDNF in the HFD offspring is not dependent on a stress hormone-mediated cascade. This is not surprising given that long-term feeding of an HFD increased serum corticosterone levels in males, but not females. IN females, HFD feeding during pregnancy and lactatin may not have an effect on the developing offspring via an adrenal hormone-dependent mechanism."

"From these data, it can be postulated that an oxidative stress-induced BDNF reduction may be one mechanism for the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis during postnatal development."

"BDNF may contribute to hippocampus-dependent cognitive alterations by mediating structural and/or functional plasticity of the hippocampus in the young HFD offspring."

"By long-term feeding of normal diet after weaning, the oxidative damages would be improved, and then, the neurogenesis and cognitive functions are recovered in the adult HFD offspring."

"diet-induced maternal obesity can affect not only metabolic function but also hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function in the offspring during early development. Similarly, previous animal studies have shown that running and swimming in pregnant or lactating mice increase neurogenesis and BDNF expression in the hippocampus of the postnatal offspring and improve the offspring's short term memory" (see refs)},

abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range ofmodels under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

abstract = {A synthesis of classical and recent thinking on the issues involved in selecting controls for case-control studies is presented in this and two companion papers (S. Wacholder et al. Am J Epidemiol 1992;135:1029-50). In this paper, a theoretical framework for selecting controls in case-control studies is developed. Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

possible threshhold effect, however, "for emotional symptoms, the point estimates also increased (albeit nonsignificantly) for the overweight and obese class I categories, suggesting a possible dose response."

"Because there is no biologic measure to serve as the gold standard for defining neurodevelopmental impact, using multiple measures with differing strengths and limitations allowed us to assess the internal validity of our findings."

"We did not observe an independent association between any outcome and excessive pregnancy weight gain. Although this finding is consistent with several studies (16, 17, 37), 2 recent studies reported positive associations. Rodriguez et al found tat excessive pregnancy weight gain among obese women increased children's ADHD risk. Bilder et al reported an association between autism spectrum disorder and high pregnancy weight gain, independent of prepregnancy BMI; however, the latter study examined prepregnancy BMI as a continuous variable and did not assess interactions between prepregnancy BMI and weight gain."

abstract = {Etiologic inferences on human teratogens are usually derived from case-control studies conducted either at birth or in spontaneous abortion series. Because both teratogens and defects may be associated with an increased risk of prenatal mortality, the possibility exists that selection bias may affect etiologic inferences. The authors derive relations between the true odds ratio (OR) relating a teratogen and a defect at the time of the occurrence of the defect and the apparent odds ratios observed in spontaneous abortion series and at birth, as functions of prenatal mortality. Depending on the pattern of interaction between the teratogen and the defect in affecting the rate of prenatal mortality, selection bias may lead to overestimation or underestimation of the true odds ratio. With increasing multiplicative effects on prenatal mortality, changes in selection bias tend to increase the observed odds ratio in spontaneous abortion series but to decrease the observed odds ratio at birth. For a range of rates of prenatal mortality, weak associations between exposures and defects (OR = 0.3-3) may well be due to selection bias; conversely, weak teratogens (OR {\textless}3) may be missed in case-control studies of defects conducted at birth. Selection bias due to prenatal mortality must be considered in the interpretation of etiologic studies of birth defects.},

abstract = {Neuropsychological functions were assessed in 174 children participating in a longitudinal study of low-level lead exposure. At age 5 1/2 years, children were administered the Working Memory and Planning Battery of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Testing Automated Battery. Measures of sociodemographic characteristics of the family, prenatal and perinatal risk, quality of caregiving and crowding in the home, and maternal and child intelligence were used as covariates to test the hypothesis that children with higher lifetime average blood lead concentrations would perform more poorly on tests of working memory, attentional flexibility, and planning and problem solving. The lifetime average blood lead level in this sample was 7.2 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dL; range: 0-20 mug/dL). Children with greater exposure performed more poorly on tests of executive processes. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, children with higher lifetime average blood lead concentrations showed impaired performance on the tests of spatial working memory, spatial memory span, intradimensional and extradimensional shifts, and an analog of the Tower of London task. Many of the significant associations remained after controlling for children's intelligence test scores, in addition to the other covariates. These findings indicate that the effects of pediatric lead exposure are not restricted to global indexes of general intellectual functioning, and executive processes may be at particular risk of lead-induced neurotoxicity.},

Excluding these pregnancies from epidemiologic studies may affect study results. We explored this effect using examples from the literature. We calculated the bias in the odds ratio caused by excluding prenatally diagnosed pregnancies when the exposure of interest is not correlated with the likelihood of terminating an affected pregnancy and when it is correlated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood. We assumed that control infants did not have birth defects. When the exposure is not associated with the likelihood of a pregnancy termination, studies excluding terminations suffer a loss of precision. When the exposure is associated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood, the odds ratios are biased toward or away from the null, respectively. The magnitude of the bias will vary according to characteristics of the study population such as the prevalence of the exposure and the frequency with which prenatal diagnosis and elective termination are used. Whenever possible, pregnancies terminated after prenatal diagnosis must be included in epidemiologic studies.},

The objective of this study is to compare the relative importance of such maternal measures as determinants of birthweight of female infants-the prospective mothers of the next generation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The study base was derived from a population-based multiethnic intergenerational cohort: the Washington State Intergenerational Cohort. Infants of mothers from four ethnic groups were included: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association between birthweight and the maternal growth and SES measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: While there were slight differences among the ethnic groups, generally each of three maternal pre-conceptional growth measures-birthweight, stature, and pre-pregnant weight-was a stronger predictor of female infant birthweight than were each of the five maternal SES factors-age, parity, marital status, educational attainment, and prenatal care onset. After accounting for the proportion of variation in birthweight explained by the maternal growth measures and maternal smoking, the addition of the five SES variables added relatively little to the prediction of infant birthweight. The maximal multiple correlation coefficients (R2) yield values ranging from 9.5{\%} to 12.8{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A mother's growth before pregnancy is a stronger predictor of infant birthweight than is her current socio-economic circumstance. Since the mother's growth must have been influenced by the socio-economic circumstances of her family of upbringing, this further highlights the intergenerational contribution on a woman's reproductive success.},

Next of kin provided information on smoking, work history, and other potential confounders. Work history data were also obtained from the Teamsters Union. While no single job category had a significant excess risk compared to the non-exposed group, certain sub-groups were elevated. The odds ratio for those with long-term employment as long-haul truckers after 1959 (an approximate date for the introduction of diesel engines) was 1.55 (95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI: 0.97, 2.47). Long-term drivers of primarily diesel trucks had an odds ratio of 1.89 (95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI: 1.04, 3.42). Overall, our results suggest that diesel truck drivers have an excess risk of lung cancer compared to other teamsters in jobs outside the trucking industry. However, our findings were not uniformly consistent and our data have many limitations, the most important of which is the lack of data on exposure to diesel fumes.},

We included 108 non-Hispanic white and 62 Hispanic families who had infants with gastroschisis, and 1,147 non-Hispanic white and 337 Hispanic families who had liveborn infants with no major structural birth defects (controls) in these analyses. DNA was extracted from buccal cells collected from infants and mothers, and information on periconceptional smoking history was obtained from maternal interviews, as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. We analyzed five polymorphisms in three genes that code for enzymes involved in metabolism of some cigarette smoke constituents (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and NAT2). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) independently for maternal smoking and maternal and infant gene variants, and to assess joint associations of maternal smoking and maternal or infant gene variants with gastroschisis. In analyses adjusted for maternal age at delivery and stratified by maternal race-ethnicity, we identified three suggestive associations among 30 potential associations with sufficient numbers to calculate ORs: CYP1A1*2A for non-Hispanic white mothers who smoked periconceptionally (aOR = 0.38, 95{\%} CI 0.15-0.98), and NAT2*6 for Hispanic non-smoking mothers (aOR = 2.17, 95{\%} CI 1.12-4.19) and their infants (aOR = 2.11, 95{\%} CI 1.00-4.48). This analysis does not support the occurrence of effect modification between periconceptional maternal smoking and most of the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme gene variants assessed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

"Besides clinical interventions through alcohol treatment programs, the most common way to prevent FASD is through behavioral interventions with pregnant women to encourage complete abstention (or at least decreasing usage) of alcohol."

"The general themes that emerged form the focus groups included using traditional language and images from the tribal communities; these were all incorporated into the marketing campaign of three posters and five radio ads... Finally, a suggestion was made by the elder women to create a more positive media campaign as opposed to the shocking and negative messages such as previous social marketing campaigns on FASD."

abstract = {Adjusting for a causal intermediate is a common analytic strategy for estimating an average causal direct effect (ACDE). The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator performs more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A strength of time-series analyses is the inherent control of individual-level risk factors that do not vary temporally. However, in studies of adverse pregnancy outcomes, risk factors considered time-invariant at the individual level may vary seasonally when aggregated into a pregnancy risk set. To illustrate, we describe the seasonal patterns of birth in Atlanta and demonstrate how these patterns could lead to confounding in time-series studies of seasonally-varying exposures and preterm birth. METHODS: The study cohort included all births in 20-county metropolitan Atlanta delivered during the period 1994-2004 (n = 715,875). We assessed the seasonal patterns of estimated conception and birth for the full cohort and for subgroups stratified by sociodemographic factors. Based on the observed patterns, we quantified the degree of potential confounding created by (1) differences in the gestational age distribution in the risk set across calendar months and (2) differences in the sociodemographic composition of the risk set across calendar months. RESULTS: The overall seasonal pattern of birth was characterized by a peak in August-September and troughs in April-May and November-January. Seasonal patterns differed among racial and ethnic groups, maternal education levels, and marital status. As a consequence of these seasonal patterns, systematic seasonal differences in the gestational age distribution and the sociodemographic composition of the risk set led to differences in expected rates of preterm birth across calendar months. CONCLUSIONS: Time-series investigations of seasonally-varying exposures and adverse pregnancy outcomes should consider the potential for bias due to seasonal heterogeneity in the risk set.},

"Birth rates during July, August, and September were 2{\%}-5{\%} higher than expected; birth rates during April, May, June, November, December and January were 2-3{\%} lower than expected."

"Notably, the college-educated group showed a peak in spring births (summer conceptions) as opposed to the trough seen among the less-educated groups. The largest April-May troughs in birth rates were observed among those who were unmarried, were Hispanic or non-Hispanic black, and had less than a high school education. The college educated, married, and non-Hispanic white groups showed a trough in births during November-January following reduced estimated conceptions in spring."

"Thus time-series investigations of exposures thought to trigger labor will require proper accounting for the gestational age distribution of the risk set to avoid confounding by gestational age."},

Propensity score based methods were used to control for potential confounders, including maternal demographic characteristics, obstetric and medical conditions, and use of other drugs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 1152 (0.13{\%}) women used a statin during the first trimester. In unadjusted analyses, the prevalence of malformations in the offspring of these women was 6.34{\%} compared with 3.55{\%} in those of women who did not use a statin in the first trimester (relative risk 1.79, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.43 to 2.23). Controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes, accounted for this increase in risk (1.07, 0.85 to 1.37). There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. Results were similar across a range of sensitivity analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our analysis did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester. However, these findings need to be replicated in other large studies, and the long term effects of in utero exposure to statins needs to be assessed, before use of statins in pregnancy can be considered safe.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have demonstrated the importance of incorporating qualitative differentiation within educational systems in the study of class inequality in student transitions. We extend these endeavors by broadening the definition of differentiation to include participation in the labor market. As increasing proportions of students continue their educational journeys beyond compulsory schooling, they are considering not only whether to stay in school but also whether to simultaneously enter the world of work. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1997 (NLSY97), we show that family background influences not only whether students make specific educational transitions but also whether they combine those educational transitions with work. Student trajectories are also path dependent, with employment during one educational transition being related to specific transition patterns at a later point in time. Considering how students combine school and work reveals another dimension of differentiation which can be exploited by socioeconomically advantaged families to "effectively maintain" inequality in educational outcomes. ?? 2009 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.},

abstract = {Gastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect where there is herniation of abdominal organs. Optimal maternal nutritional intake, in particular, fatty acids, are vital for proper growth and development of the fetus. This pilot case–control study explored the association of several biomarkers of fatty acids and gastroschisis. Between 2008 and 2011, we recruited 13 pregnant women in mid-gestation who were referred to the UCSD Prenatal Center for evaluation of an abnormal maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test and subsequently identified as carrying a baby with gastroschisis. Nine controls were selected from a false positive MSAFP or from the UCSD prenatal clinic. At enrollment, maternal blood was drawn for analysis of fatty acids. Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests were used to test for mean differences between erythrocyte fatty acid biomarkers and the fatty acid lipogenic (palmitic acid: linoleic acid) and desaturation (palmitoleic acid: palmitic acid) indices and gastroschisis. Mothers carrying a baby with gastroschisis and gastroschisis babies had consistently higher levels of palmitoleic acid (all P's {\textless} 0.05), gastroschisis mothers had lower levels of oleic acid during pregnancy and at delivery, and higher levels of DHA at delivery (all P's {\textless} 0.05). The lipogenic index was significantly lower at delivery for gastroschisis mothers (P {\textless} 0.05) and the desaturation index was consistently higher in gastroschisis mothers and babies (all P's {\textless} 0.01). These findings suggest that early maternal inflammation possibly resulting from an imbalance of fatty acids, leading to a vascular disruption, may be the underlying mechanism responsible for at least some cases of gastroschisis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We hypothesized that low maternal body mass index (BMI) would predict worse neurodevelopmental status in children, while higher maternal BMIs would be associated with better neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHODS: Psychomotor tests for general intelligence and motor skills were given to 355 children at a mean age of 5.3 years. Maternal nutritional status was assessed by prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weight gain during pregnancy. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of the women in this study were overweight or obese. The means of the general IQ, nonverbal and verbal ability, and Gross Motor Scales of the children were 82.1 +/- 12.6, 87.4 +/- 15.7, 80.1 +/- 10.8 and 332.3 +/- 13.2, respectively. Seventeen percent of the children had general IQ scores of less than 70. To our surprise, in multiple regression analyses, adjusting for other covariates, maternal prepregnancy BMI was a significant negative predictor of IQ (beta = - 0.25, P = 0.001) and nonverbal ability (beta = - 0.29, P = 0.02). The IQ and nonverbal scores of children of women who were obese before pregnancy were approximately 5 units lower than for children whose mothers had a normal prepregnancy BMI. The other significant predictors of IQ and nonverbal scores of the children were childcare status (beta = 3.5, P = 0.04 and beta = 0.26, P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively) and the mother's receptive language scores (beta = 5.2, P = 0.01 and beta = 0.25, P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study of low-income African-American children indicates that obese women are at risk of having children with diminished intellectual ability, but not motor skills.},

abstract = {The authors previously demonstrated decreased levels of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis compared to women without endometriosis. Here, the authors determine whether women with endometriosis have altered levels of PEDF in serum. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 71 women with and without endometriosis (n = 43 and 28, respectively) before laparoscopic surgery. Concentrations of serum PEDF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We detected lower levels of serum PEDF in women with endometriosis (16.3 ± 6.6 ng/mL) than in those without endometriosis (24.5 ± 7.3 ng/mL; P {\textless} .001). In women with endometriosis, the concentrations of serum PEDF were significantly lower in women with pain (n = 11, 12.6 ± 7.1 ng/mL) compared to women without pain (n = 32, 17.5 ± 6.0 ng/mL; P {\textless} .05). However, the concentrations of serum PEDF did not correlate with disease stage or site or infertility. In addition, the concentrations of serum PEDF did not show any difference in the phase of the cycle in either group. Our results suggest that reduced levels of serum PEDF in women with endometriosis and disease-related pain may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

We conducted a linear regression analysis of the weight with month and year of birth, sex, maternal age, diabetes, and several meteorological factors as independent variables, which were also incorporated into multivariate logistic regression models to examine the effect of season of birth on the frequency of low birth weight (LBW, {\textless}2500 g) or macrosomia ({\textgreater}4000 g).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significant (P {\textless} .001) seasonal pattern in birth weights was observed, with a peak in July and a trough in January.

No such pattern was found for LBW.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: While in regions of mid-latitude, summer is associated with relatively lower birth weight, possibly because of exposure to cold temperature during early or mid-pregnancy, our data suggest that in Israel, the peak birth weight is in summer, possibly because of increased exposure to sunlight in the last weeks of the pregnancy.},

abstract = {Surrogates which allow one to predict the effect of the treatment on the outcome of interest from the effect of the treatment on the surrogate are of importance when it is difficult or expensive to measure the primary outcome. Unfortunately, the use of such surrogates can give rise to paradoxical situations in which the effect of the treatment on the surrogate is positive, the surrogate and outcome are strongly positively correlated, but the effect of the treatment on the outcome is negative, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the "surrogate paradox." New results are given for consistent surrogates that extend the existing literature on sufficient conditions that ensure the surrogate paradox is not manifest. Specifically, it is shown that for the surrogate paradox to be manifest it must be the case that either there is (i) a direct effect of treatment on the outcome not through the surrogate and in the opposite direction as that through the surrogate or (ii) confounding for the effect of the surrogate on the outcome, or (iii) a lack of transitivity so that treatment does not positively affect the surrogate for all the same individuals for whom the surrogate positively affects the outcome. The conditions for consistent surrogates and the results of the article are important because they allow investigators to predict the direction of the effect of the treatment on the outcome simply from the direction of the effect of the treatment on the surrogate. These results on consistent surrogates are then related to the four approaches to surrogate outcomes described by Joffe and Greene (2009, Biometrics 65, 530-538) to assess whether the standard criteria used by these approaches to assess whether a surrogate is "good" suffice to avoid the surrogate paradox.},

abstract = {Although 40{\%} of US women indicate they are currently trying to lose weight, the association between intentional weight loss and longevity is unknown. The authors analyzed prospective data from 43,457 overweight, never-smoking US white women aged 40–64 years who in 1959–1960 completed a questionnaire that included questions on weight change direction, amount, time interval, and intentionallty. Vital status was determined in 1972. Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratios for women who intentionally lost weight compared with women who had no change in weight. Women who died within the first 3 years of follow-up were excluded. Analyses were stratified by preexisting illness and adjusted for age, beginning body mass index, alcohol intake, education, physical activity, and health conditions. In women with obesity-related health conditions (n = 15,069), intentional weight loss of any amount was associated with a 20{\%} reduction in all-cause mortality, primarily due to a 40–50{\%} reduction in mortality from obesity-related cancers; diabetes-associated mortality was also reduced by 30–40{\%} in those who intentionally lost weight. In women with no preexisting illness {\{}n = 28,388), intentional weight loss of ≥20 Ib (≥9.1 kg) that occurred within the previous year was associated with about a 25{\%} reduction in all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality; however, loss of {\textless}20 Ib ({\textless}9.1 kg) or loss that occurred over an interval of ≥1 year was generally associated with small to modest increases in mortality. The association between intentional weight loss and longevity in middle-aged overweight women appears to depend on their health status. Intentional weight loss among women with obesity-related conditions is generally associated with decreased premature mortality, whereas among women with no preexisting illness, the association is equivocal.}},

abstract = {STUDY QUESTION What is the semen quality of young adult men who were conceived 18-22 years ago by ICSI for male infertility? SUMMARY ANSWER In this cohort of 54 young adult ICSI men, median sperm concentration, total sperm count and total motile sperm count were significantly lower than in spontaneously conceived peers. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY The oldest ICSI offspring cohort worldwide has recently reached adulthood. Hence, their reproductive health can now be investigated. Since these children were conceived by ICSI because of severe male-factor infertility, there is reasonable concern that male offspring have inherited the deficient spermatogenesis from their fathers. Previously normal pubertal development and adequate Sertoli and Leydig cell function have been described in pubertal ICSI boys; however, no information on their sperm quality is currently available. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This study was conducted at UZ Brussel between March 2013 and April 2016 and is part of a large follow-up project focussing on reproductive and metabolic health of young adults, between 18 and 22 years and conceived after ICSI with ejaculated sperm. Results of both a physical examination and semen analysis were compared between young ICSI men being part of a longitudinally followed cohort and spontaneously conceived controls who were recruited cross-sectionally. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHOD Results of a single semen sample in 54 young adult ICSI men and 57 spontaneously conceived men are reported. All young adults were individually assessed, and the results of their physical examination were completed by questionnaires. Data were analysed by multiple linear and logistic regression, adjusted for covariates. In addition, semen parameters of the ICSI fathers dating back from their ICSI treatment application were analysed for correlations. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Young ICSI adults had a lower median sperm concentration (17.7 million/ml), lower median total sperm count (31.9 million) and lower median total motile sperm count (12.7 million) in comparison to spontaneously conceived peers (37.0 million/ml; 86.8 million; 38.6 million, respectively). The median percentage progressive and total motility, median percentage normal morphology and median semen volume were not significantly different between these groups. After adjustment for confounders (age, BMI, genital malformations, time from ejaculation to analysis, abstinence period), the statistically significant differences between ICSI men and spontaneously conceived peers remained: an almost doubled sperm concentration in spontaneously conceived peers in comparison to ICSI men (ratio 1.9, 95{\%} CI 1.1-3.2) and a two-fold lower total sperm count (ratio 2.3, 95{\%} CI 1.3-4.1) and total motile count (ratio 2.1, 95{\%} CI 1.2-3.6) in ICSI men compared to controls were found. Furthermore, compared to men born after spontaneous conception, ICSI men were nearly three times more likely to have sperm concentrations below the WHO reference value of 15 million/ml (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.7; 95{\%} CI 1.1-6.7) and four times more likely to have total sperm counts below 39 million (AOR 4.3; 95{\%} CI 1.7-11.3). In this small group of 54 father-son pairs, a weak negative correlation between total sperm count in fathers and their sons was found. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The main limitation is the small study population. Also, the results of this study where ICSI was performed with ejaculated sperm and for male-factor infertility cannot be generalized to all ICSI offspring because the indications for ICSI have nowadays been extended and ICSI is also being performed with non-ejaculated sperm and reported differences may thus either decrease or increase. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These first results in a small group of ICSI men indicate a lower semen quantity and quality in young adults born after ICSI for male infertility in their fathers. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS This study was supported by Methusalem grants and by grants from Wetenschappelijk Fonds Willy Gepts, all issued by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).

abstract = {"Non-traditional" educational trajectories are increasingly common among American students. This study assesses the implications of this phenomenon for inequality in educational attainment. A proper account of educational trajectories requires simultaneous consideration of qualitatively different types of destinations within educational transitions, of the timing at which different transitions occur, and of the sequence of events within educational levels. To examine "traditional" and "non-traditional" pathways through post-secondary education, this study relies on detailed educational histories from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979-2002. Findings reveal that deviations from a traditional trajectory are widespread, are more frequent among students who enrolled in less selective colleges, and also among socioeconomically and academically disadvantaged students. Results show that following a "non-traditional" pathway reduces students' chances to enroll in college and to complete a post-secondary degree. In the case of bachelor's degree completion, most of the observed gap among students from different socioeconomic backgrounds is accounted for the different trajectories students follow. This study demonstrates that a fine-grained analysis of students' trajectories improves our understanding of the persistent socioeconomic disparities in educational attainment. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.},

abstract = {To study teratogenicity of cocaine in humans, we studied three groups of pregnant women and their offspring: group 1, 50 women who abused cocaine only; group 2, 110 women who were polydrug abusers; and group 3, 340 who were drug free. All three groups were similar for socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking, and ethnicity. Maternal age of group 1 was similar to that of group 3, but group 2 mothers were significantly older. Gravidity was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3. No statistical difference was found in spontaneous abortion rate among the three groups, but the stillbirth rate was significantly higher in group 1 ($\xi$2=6.89, P≤0.01). All stillbirths were related to abruptio placentae. Birth weight, length, and head circumference were significantly decreased in infants in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3 (P≤0.0001), but no statistical difference was found between groups 1 and 2. The congenital malformation rate was significantly higher in group 1 compared with group 3 ($\xi$2=7.07, P≤0.01). We conclude that cocaine abuse in humans significantly reduces weight of the fetus, increases the stillbirth rate related to abruptio placentae, and is associated with a higher malformation rate.},

This analysis decomposes the variation in a series into trend, seasonal variation, other cyclic changes, and a remaining irregular fluctuation. The results of the present analysis support the existence of a seasonal rhythm of mean birth weight and mean gestational period in Japan with statistical significance (p |is less than{\~{}} 0.001). Seasonal patterns of mean birth weight show two peaks in May and October-November and two troughs in June-September and December. Mean gestational periods shows two peaks in October and February-March and a deep trough in winter and a much smaller one in June-September. Two time series demonstrated a coincidence in monthly variations with statistical significance. These results indicate that a part of seasonality in birth weight could be explained by the seasonal variations in mean gestational period.},

Although biochemical and immuno- logical abnormalities develop several years before the clinical onset of insulin dependent diabetes, the age at which exposure to infection might induce the disease is unclear. The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with the congenital rubella syndrome shows that the process may be initiated in utero.1 As most viral infections are seasonal, the pattern of dates of birth of people with diabetes should differ from that of the gen- eral population if a significant proportion of cases was caused by intrauterine or perinatal viral infection. We therefore examined seasonality of birth in three large independent populations of children with insulin dependent diabetes in Britain.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A previous paper used latent class analysis to assign individuals to 1 of 4 adolescent/young adult smoking trajectory classes and then established an association between maternal smoking before, during, and after pregnancy and these classes. In this paper, we examine one possible pathway for this relationship: that maternal smoking during pregnancy may set off a behavioral trajectory which increases the likelihood of problem behaviors generally, of which smoking is one manifestation. METHODS: We used the Behavior Problems Index measure from age 8 through age 12 as a potential mediator. We used a path analysis modeling approach within a multinomial logistic regression (using Mplus) to estimate direct and indirect effects (via behavioral problems) between maternal smoking pattern and child trajectory class. RESULTS: We found small but statistically significant indirect effects via behavioral problems from maternal smoking to child smoking trajectory for membership in all 3 smoking classes, relative to the nonsmoking trajectory, indicating partial mediation. Mediated effects were associated with maternal smoking after pregnancy, no statistically significant mediated effects were found for smoking before or during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The results provided no evidence that the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on child smoking trajectory are mediated by problem behavior. Effects from smoking after birth to child smoking trajectory appear to be partially mediated by problem behavior, supporting a behavioral rather than physiological effect of smoking during pregnancy but not ruling out more complex physiological pathways.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There are challenges in delivering maternal and infant health (MIH) care to remote Northern Territory (NT) communities. These include fragmented care with birthing in regional hospitals resulting in cultural and geographical dislocation for Aboriginal women. Many NT initiatives are aimed at improving care. Indicators for evaluating these for remote Aboriginal mothers and infants need to be clearer. We reviewed existing indicators to inform a set of pragmatic indicators for reporting improvement in remote MIH care. METHODS: Scientific databases and grey literature (organisational websites and Google Scholar) were searched using the terms 'Aboriginal/maternal/infant/remote health/monitoring performance'. Key stakeholders identified omitted indicators sets. Relevant sets were reviewed and organised by indicator type, stage of patient journey, topic and theme. RESULTS: Forty-two indicators sets were found. Seven focused on Aboriginal health, 23 on reproductive/maternal health, eight on child/infant health and four on other aspects, e.g. remote health. We identified more than 1,000 individual indicators. Of these, 656 were relevant for our purpose and were subsequently organised into 300 topics and 16 themes for antenatal, birth and postpartum, and infant care by indicator type. CONCLUSION: There are many measures for monitoring health care delivery to mothers and infants. Few are framed around remote MIH services, despite poorer health outcomes of remote mothers and infants and the specific challenges with providing care in this setting. Establishing relevant indicators is vital to support relevant data collection and the development of appropriate policy for remote Aboriginal maternal and infant care.},

abstract = {Non-identifiability of parameters is a well-recognized problem in classical statistics, and Bayesian statisticians have long recognized the importance of exchangeability assumptions in making statistical inferences. A seemingly unrelated problem in epidemiology is that of confounding: bias in estimation of the effects of an exposure on disease risk, due to inherent differences in risk between exposed and unexposed individuals. Using a simple deterministic model for exposure effects, a logical connection is drawn between the concepts of identifiability, exchangeability, and confounding. This connection allows one to view the problem of confounding as arising from problems of identifiability, and reveals the exchangeability assumptions that are implicit in confounder control methods. It also provides further justification for confounder definitions based on comparability of exposure groups, as opposed to collapsibility-based definitions.},

EPL was the outcome of 286 (15.8{\%}) pregnancies. EPL rates for the different conception modes were as follows: spontaneous 14.5{\%} (125/864), ovulation induction 15.8{\%} (42/266), intrauterine insemination 25.0{\%} (5/20), intrauterine insemination combined with ovarian stimulation 18.2{\%} (37/203), IVF 16.3{\%} (31/190), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 14.9{\%} (30/202) and frozen embryo transfer (FET) 26.2{\%} (16/61). After adjusting for female age, male age, hospital, obstetric history, female smoking habit, male alcohol use, menstrual cycle type and infertility diagnosis, the EPL rate after FET was significantly increased (odds ratio 2.2, 95{\%} CI 1.14-4.19) compared with spontaneous conception. Embryo quality was comparable in fresh and frozen embryos. Other fertility treatments showed no increased miscarriage rate.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the healthy worker survivor effect (HWSE) in a study of Vermont granite workers by distinguishing "prevalent" from "incident" hires based on date of hire before or after the start of follow-up. METHODS: Records of workers between 1950 and 1982 were obtained from a medical surveillance programme. Proportional hazards models were used to model the association between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality, with penalised splines used to smooth the exposure-response relationship. A sensitivity analysis compared results between the original cohort and subcohorts defined by restricting date of hire to include varying proportions of prevalent hires. RESULTS: Restricting to incident hires reduced the 213 cases by 74{\%} and decreased the exposure range. The maximum mortality rate ratio (MRR) was close to twofold in all subcohorts. However, the exposure at which the maximum MRR was achieved decreased from 4.0 to 0.6 mg-year/m3 as the proportion of prevalent hires decreased from 50{\%} in the original cohort to 0{\%} in the subcohort of incident hires. CONCLUSION: Despite loss in power and restricted exposure range, decreasing the relative proportion of prevalent to incident hires reduced HWSE bias, resulting in stronger evidence for a dose-response between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality.},

abstract = {The survival difference between adherers and non-adherers to placebo in the Coronary Drug Project has been used to support the thesis that adherence adjustment in randomized trials is not generally possible and, therefore, that only intention-to-treat analyses should be trusted. We previously demonstrated that adherence adjustment can be validly conducted in the Coronary Drug Project using a simplistic approach. Here, we re-analyze the data using an approach that takes full advantage of recent methodological developments. We used inverse-probability weighted hazards models to estimate the 5-year survival and mortality risk when individuals in the placebo arm of the Coronary Drug Project adhere to at least 80{\%} of the drug continuously or never during the 5-year follow-up period. Adjustment for post-randomization covariates resulted in 5-year mortality risk difference estimates ranging from − 0.7 (95{\%} confidence intervals (CI), − 12.2, 10.7) to 4.5 (95{\%} CI, − 6.3, 15.3) percentage points. Our analysis confirms that appropriate adjustment for post-randomization predictors of adherence largely removes the association between adherence to placebo and mortality originally described in this trial.

abstract = {Excessive gestational weight gain and obesity have been recognized as independent risk factors for maternal and fetal complications of pregnancy with significant lifelong consequences. These associations call into question the recently released Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain recommendations, particularly for obese women. The IOM recommendation of a single standard of weight gain for all obesity classes is also of concern, because higher body mass index levels are associated with more severe pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The IOM recommendations retained the 1990 focus on the theoretical association between poor gestational weight gain and low birth weight (LBW). Low gestational weight gain may often be a consequence and not the cause of LBW, and there is a lack of evidence in developed countries that dietary supplementation increases birth weight. Current obstetric practice allows for accurate and timely diagnosis of and intervention for LBW. We submit that gestational weight gain recommendations should be more individualized especially for obese women. Obese pregnant women should not be precluded from partaking in healthy lifestyle modifications in pregnancy that include physical activities, modified, judicious diets, and limited weight gain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research on alcohol consumption during pregnancy and miscarriage spans over three decades, yet the relationship is still not well-understood. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between volume and type of alcohol consumed during pregnancy in relation to miscarriage. METHODS: We utilized data from a population-based cohort study of pregnant women (n = 1061) of which 172 (16{\%}) women had a miscarriage. Upon study entry, participants were asked about their alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Based on the average number of drinks per week, women were categorized into one of three categories: four or more drinks per week (n = 32, 3{\%}), less than four drinks per week (n = 403, 38{\%}), and no alcohol intake (n = 626, 59{\%}). In addition, women were categorized by the type of alcohol beverage they consumed: beer only (n = 47, 4{\%}), spirits only (n = 56, 5{\%}), wine only (n = 160, 15{\%}), or a combination of two or more types of alcohol (n = 172, 16{\%}). RESULTS: A significant increased risk of miscarriage (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 2.65; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.38, 5.10) was found for women who drank four or more drinks a week. Our findings also suggest the relationship between alcohol intake during pregnancy and miscarriage is strongest for miscarriage occurring prior to 10 weeks of gestation. In addition, women who drank only spirits had more than a two-fold increased risk of miscarriage compared to women who abstained (aHR: 2.24; 95{\%} CI: 1.32, 3.81). Conclusions/Importance: Future research assessing the factors that may contribute to an increased risk of miscarriage should consider the type of alcohol consumed.},

Modelling approaches are proposed for the difference between a treatment-specific counterfactual population distribution and the actual population distribution of an outcome in the target population of interest. Relevant parameters describe the effect of a hypothetical intervention on such a population and therefore we refer to these models as population intervention models. We focus on intervention models estimating the effect of an intervention in terms of a difference and ratio of means, called risk difference and relative risk if the outcome is binary. We provide a class of inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted and doubly-robust estimators of the causal parameters in these models. The finite-sample performance of these new estimators is explored in a simulation study.},

With ML and GLS methods, we recommend the use of SRMR, supplemented by TLI, BL89, RNI, CFI, gamma hat, Me, or RMSEA (TLI, Me, and RMSEA are less preferable at small sample sizes). With the ADF method, we recommend the use of SRMR, supplemented by TLI, BL89, RNI, or CFI.

As predicted by earlier research, associations increased at the extremes of discordance, even in a longitudinal, cross-rater design, with effect sizes reaching as high as 12{\%}. As with previous research some of these nonshared environmental (NSE) relationships appeared to operate partly as a function of SES, family chaos and maternal depression.

SETTING: National birth defects prevention study, a multisite, population based study including 10 surveillance systems for birth defects in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Mothers of 505 offspring with gastroschisis and 4924 healthy liveborn infants as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adjusted odds ratios for gastroschisis with 95{\%} confidence intervals. RESULTS: About 16{\%} (n=81) of case mothers and 9{\%} (n=425) of control mothers reported a genitourinary infection in the relevant time period; 4{\%} (n=21) and 2{\%} (n=98) reported a sexually transmitted infection and 13{\%} (n=67) and 7{\%} (n=338) reported a urinary tract infection, respectively. Case mothers aged {\textless}25 years reported higher rates of urinary tract infection alone and in combination with a sexually transmitted infection compared with control mothers. In women who reported both types of infection, there was a greater risk of gastroschisis in offspring (adjusted odds ratio 4.0, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.4 to 11.6). CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between self reported urinary tract infection plus sexually transmitted infection just before conception and in early pregnancy and gastroschisis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional research has suggested that television viewing may be associated with decreased attention spans in children. However, longitudinal data of early television exposure and subsequent attentional problems have been lacking. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that early television exposure (at ages 1 and 3) is associated with attentional problems at age 7. METHODS: We used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a representative longitudinal data set. Our main outcome was the hyperactivity subscale of the Behavioral Problems Index determined on all participants at age 7. Children who were {\textgreater} or = 1.2 standard deviations above the mean were classified as having attentional problems. Our main predictor was hours of television watched daily at ages 1 and 3 years. RESULTS: Data were available for 1278 children at age 1 and 1345 children at age 3. Ten percent of children had attentional problems at age 7. In a logistic regression model, hours of television viewed per day at both ages 1 and 3 was associated with attentional problems at age 7 (1.09 [1.03-1.15] and 1.09 [1.02-1.16]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Early television exposure is associated with attentional problems at age 7. Efforts to limit television viewing in early childhood may be warranted, and additional research is needed.},

abstract = {The potential for recall bias in case-control studies is a common concern. The authors assessed whether recall bias was present in exposure information reported at postpartum interview by mothers of malformed and nonmalformed infants who delivered at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, during 1984. Accuracy of exposure reporting was measured by comparing interview data with exposure information documented during pregnancy in obstetric records. The authors' measure of recall bias, relative sensitivity (RS), is the ratio of exposure-reporting accuracy for mothers of malformed infants to that of mothers of nonmalformed infants. Relative sensitivity estimates that are greater than 1.0 indicate that mothers of malformed infants are more accurate reporters than mothers of nonmalformed infants. Relative sensitivity was estimated for eight exposure factors: antibiotic or antifungal drug use (RS = 1.2), urinary tract or yeast infection (RS = 2.7), history of infertility (RS = 1.4), use of birth control after conception (RS = 7.6), elective abortion history (RS = 1.1), any over-the-counter drug use (RS = 1.0), spotting or bleeding (RS = 1.2), and nausea or vomiting (RS = 0.8) These data suggest the presence of recall bias for some exposure factors. The authors advise the use of malformed controls to reduce potential recall bias in case-control studies of selected malformations and many etiologic factors.},

Animal models demonstrate that early iron deficiency affects neuronal and glial energy metabolism, monoamine metabolism and myelination, consistent with behavioural findings in human infants. Of particular recent interest are genomic changes in transcripts coding for signal transduction, dendritic structure and energy metabolism induced by early iron deficiency that last well into adulthood in spite of iron treatment.

abstract = {In the disease of endometriosis, endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus, usually in the peritoneal cavity. Rodent models of endometriosis allow a way to reproduce the disease, evaluate effects of chemicals, and study mechanisms. Twenty-one days prior to induction surgery which produces endometriosis, female Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F1 mice were pretreated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at 0, 3 or 10 micrograms TCDD/kg. Animals were treated again at the time of surgery and at 3, 6, and 9 weeks following surgery. Evaluations were made at 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks postsurgery. TCDD produced a dose-dependent increase in endometriotic site diameter when all time points were pooled within each dose in rats and a dramatic increase in site diameter in mice at 9 and 12 weeks. In rats but not mice, ovarian weight was decreased at 9 and 12 weeks, the occurrence of persistent vaginal estrus was increased at these times, and histological evaluation of the ovaries revealed ovulatory arrest at 12 weeks. In both species, thymic antrophy, indicating immune dysfunction, and hepatomegaly were observed as consequences of TCDD exposure. Body weight was reduced in rats but not in mice. Histological evaluations of endometriotic sites revealed fibrosis in control rats, necrotic and inflammatory changes in the sites from TCDD-treated rats, and predominantly fibrotic changes in sites from TCDD-treated mice. Differences observed between the rat and the mouse with respect to (a) the magnitude of the effect on endometrial site diameter (rats {\textless} mice), (b) measured effects on ovarian function (rats {\textgreater} mice) that may be based on the partial antiestrogenicity of TCDD, and (c) evidence that mice and rats differ in their immune response to TCDD suggest that the mechanisms mediating TCDD's action to promote endometriosis are complex and may be different in rats and mice. The mouse may be a better model for future studies necessary to elucidate these mechanisms.},

More studies indicated that mental health appears to be more strongly associated with concern about weight and shape, regardless of body mass index (BMI). Using the data from a national large school-based cohort (N = 10 403), we examined the association between obesity, perceived obesity and mental health. There was no relationship between BMI weight status and psychopathological symptoms after adjusting for weight perception and other factors for both genders. More importantly, it was determined that perception of weight as either underweight or overweight was related to higher behavioral symptoms and social adaptation problems. In conclusion, psychological well-being of adolescents is more related to weight perception than BMI is.},

abstract = {Exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been suggested as a possible etiologic factor for endometriosis, but the association remains highly controversial. To assess whether cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene polymorphisms modulate the effect of dioxins and/or PCBs in endometriosis risk, we conducted a case-control study among infertile Japanese women. A total of 138 eligible women aged 20-45 were diagnosed laparoscopically and classified into three subgroups: control (no endometriosis), early endometriosis (stages I-II) and advanced endometriosis (stages III-IV). Neither CYP1A1 Ile462Val and CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphisms (genotypes with versus genotypes without the minor allele) nor serum dioxin and PCB toxic equivalency (TEQ) levels (low versus high) were independently associated with either early or advanced endometriosis risk. However, genotypes with the CYP1A1 462Val allele showed a statistically significant reduced risk of advanced endometriosis in combination with high serum dioxin TEQ levels (adjusted odds ratio = 0.13, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.02-0.76) (P for interaction = 0.08). Although no association was found between serum PCB TEQ level and advanced endometriosis in any stratum of CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism, a statistically significant interaction was found (P for interaction = 0.05). CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 polymorphisms may modify the relation between environmental exposure to organochlorine and advanced endometriosis risk.},

abstract = {Background: A Zika virus epidemic emerged in northeast Brazil in 2015 and was followed by a striking increase in congenital microcephaly cases, triggering a declaration of an international public health emergency. This is the final report of the first case-control study evaluating the potential causes of microcephaly: congenital Zika virus infection, vaccines, and larvicides. The published preliminary report suggested a strong association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection. Methods: We did a case-control study in eight public maternity hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates born with microcephaly, defined as a head circumference of 2 SD below the mean. Two controls without microcephaly were matched to each case by expected date of delivery and area of residence. We tested the serum of cases and controls and the CSF of cases for detection of Zika virus genomes with quantitative RT-PCR and for detection of IgM antibodies with capture-IgM ELISA. We also tested maternal serum with plaque reduction neutralisation assays for Zika and dengue viruses. We estimated matched crude and adjusted odds ratios with exact conditional logistic regression to determine the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection. Findings: We screened neonates born between Jan 15 and Nov 30, 2016, and prospectively recruited 91 cases and 173 controls. In 32 (35{\%}) cases, congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed by laboratory tests and no controls had confirmed Zika virus infections. 69 (83{\%}) of 83 cases with known birthweight were small for gestational age, compared with eight (5{\%}) of 173 controls. The overall matched odds ratio was 73{\textperiodcentered}1 (95{\%} CI 13{\textperiodcentered}0-∞) for microcephaly and Zika virus infection after adjustments. Neither vaccination during pregnancy or use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen was associated with microcephaly. Results of laboratory tests for Zika virus and brain imaging results were available for 79 (87{\%}) cases; within these cases, ten were positive for Zika virus and had cerebral abnormalities, 13 were positive for Zika infection but had no cerebral abnormalities, and 11 were negative for Zika virus but had cerebral abnormalities. Interpretation: The association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed. We provide evidence of the absence of an effect of other potential factors, such as exposure to pyriproxyfen or vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, measles and rubella, or measles, mumps, and rubella) during pregnancy, confirming the findings of an ecological study of pyriproxyfen in Pernambuco and previous studies on the safety of Tdap vaccine administration during pregnancy.

abstract = {Recently, attention has focused on whether particulate air pollution is a specific trigger of myocardial infarction (MI). The results of several studies of single locations assessing the effects of ambient particular matter on the risk of MI have been disparate. We used a multicity case-crossover study to examine risk of emergency hospitalization associated with fine particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter {\textless} 10 mu m (PM10) for {\textgreater} 300,000 MIs during 1985-1999 among elderly residents of 21 U.S. cities. We used time-stratified controls matched on day of the week or on temperature to detect possible residual confounding by weather. Overall, we found a 0.65{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (0), 0.3-1.0{\%}] increased risk of hospitalization for MI per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in ambient PM10 concentration. Matching on apparent temperature yielded a 0.64{\%} increase in risk (95{\%} CI, 0.1-1.2{\%}). We found that the effect size for PM10 doubled for subjects with a previous admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There was a weaker indication of a larger effect on males but no evidence of effect modification by age or the other diagnoses. We also found that the shape of the exposure-response relationship between MI hospitalizations and PM10 is almost linear, but with a steeper slope at levels of PM10 {\textless} 50 mu g/m(3). We conclude that increased concentrations of ambient PM10 are associated with increased risk of MI among the elderly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aspiration of the granulosa cells that surround the oocyte and the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) during assisted reproduction technology (ART) treatment can interfere with the production, during the luteal phase, of progesterone, which is necessary for successful implantation of the embryo. Providing hormonal supplementation during the luteal phase with either progesterone itself, or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which stimulates progesterone production, may improve implantation and, thus, pregnancy rates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To determine (1) if luteal phase support after assisted reproduction increases the pregnancy rate, (2) the optimal hormone for luteal phase support, i.e. hCG, progesterone, or a combination of both, and (3) the optimal route of progesterone administration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders {\&} Subfertility Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1971 to Dec 2003), EMBASE (1985 to Dec 2003). We handsearched reference lists of relevant articles were scanned, and abstract books from scientific meetings up to December 2003.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of luteal phase support after ART treatment, comparing hCG or progesterone with placebo or no treatment, comparing progesterone with hCG, progesterone plus hCG, or progesterone plus estrogen, or comparing different routes of progesterone administration. Quasi-randomized trials were excluded from the main analyses, but included in a secondary analysis for each comparison.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each comparison, data on live birth, ongoing and clinical pregnancy per embryo or gamete transfer procedure, miscarriage per clinical pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per transfer, and multiple pregnancy per clinical pregnancy were extracted into 2 x 2 tables and subgrouped by use of GnRHa in the ovarian stimulation regimen. The odds ratio (OR) and risk difference (RD) were calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies were included in the review. Luteal phase support with hCG provided significant benefit, compared to placebo or no treatment, in terms of increased ongoing pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 2.38, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 4.29) and decreased miscarriage rates (OR 0.12, 95{\%} CI 0.03 to 0.50), but only when GnRHa was used. The odds of OHSS increased 20-fold when hCG was used in cycles with GnRHa. Progesterone use resulted in a small but significant increase in pregnancy rates (OR 1.34, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.79) when trials with and without GnRHa were grouped together, but no effect on the miscarriage rate was observed. No significant difference was found between progesterone and hCG or between progesterone and progesterone plus hCG or estrogen in terms of pregnancy or miscarriage rates, but the odds of OHSS were more than 2-fold higher with treatments involving hCG than with progesterone alone(OR 3.06, 95{\%} CI 1.59 to 5.86). Comparing routes of progesterone administration, reductions in clinical pregnancy rate with the oral route, compared to the intramuscular or vaginal routes, did not reach statistical significance, but there was evidence of benefit of the intramuscular over the vaginal route for the outcomes of ongoing pregnancy and live birth. No significant difference in pregnancy rate was observed between vaginal progesterone gel and other types of vaginal progesterone.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Luteal phase support with hCG or progesterone after assisted reproduction results in an increased pregnancy rate. hCG does not provide better results than progesterone, and is associated with a greater risk of OHSS when used with GnRHa. The optimal route of progesterone administration has not yet been established.},

The BPI contains six subscales derived through factor analysis(...) and trichotomous factor scales reflecting externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behaviors. Because the individual subscales have a small numer of items and lower reliability and we were interested in child behavior problems most strongly associated with marital status and maternal delinquent activities, the Externalizing Scale alone was analyzed (3)....

abstract = {Selection bias is a concern in cohort studies in which selection into the cohort is related to the studied outcome. An example is chronic infection with hepatitis C virus, where the initial infection may be asymptomatic for decades. This problem leads to selection of more severely ill individuals into registers of such infections. Cohort studies often adjust for this bias by introducing a time window between entry into the cohort and entry into the study. This paper describes and assesses a novel method to improve adjustment for this type of selection bias. The size of the time window is decided by calculating a standardized incidence ratio as a continuous function of the size of the time window. The resulting graph is used to decide on an appropriate window size. The method is evaluated by using the Swedish register of hepatitis C virus infections for 1990-2006. The complications studied were non-Hodgkin lymphoma and liver cancer. Selection bias differed for the studied outcomes, and a time window of a minimum of 2 months and 12 months, respectively, was judged to be appropriate. The novel method may have advantages compared with an interval-based method, especially in cohort studies with small numbers of events.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the first description of the foetal damage of alcohol in 1967, numerous studies have outlined different aspects of neurodevelopmental dysfunction, adversely affecting the lives of children worldwide. Although the cause of the syndrome is sorted out, the pathogenesis of brain damage is far from being clear. In contrast to children exhibiting the full facial dysmorphology, who are relatively easy to diagnose, in those presenting only with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental damage diagnosis is much more challenging due to poor specificity of the brain dysfunction. Hence, identifying the neurodevelopmental phenotype of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a major challenge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Recently, a behavioural phenotype of FASD has been described and validated using items from the Child Behaviour Checklist. This tool has high sensitivity and specificity in separating children with FASD from those with ADHD and from healthy controls. In parallel, a number of intervention studies show promise in improving the abilities of children and adolescents with the syndrome to cope with daily tasks and improve their quality of life.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: The neurobehavioural screening test can facilitate screening for FASD and is an official screening tool in the FASD toolkit of the Public Health Agency of Canada. Promising new interventions may attenuate the long-term outcome of these children.},

abstract = {The performance of 3 approximate CI methods for the odds ratio (R) is studied at the 95{\%} level in the unconditional sample space. They are the method proposed by Cornfield, the logit method with 1/2 corrections first considered by Woolf, and the test-based method proposed by Miettinen. Cornfield's method comes closest to attaining the nominal confidence coefficient. The logit method typically has actual confidence coefficients somewhat too lartge with disparate tail areas. The latter is ascribed in part to the enhanced skewness induced by the logit transformation itself. The test-based method has actual coefficients uniformly less than nominal when R not= 1. This underestimation is worse in finite samples than Halperin found it to be asymptotically. Although the Cornfield and test-based methods have the same confidence coefficients for R = 1, the test-based method is more likely to cover distant values of R not= 1 when in fact R =1. It is concluded that Cornfields's method without the continuity correction is the preferred approximate method in the unconditional space as, with the continuity correction, it was previously found to be in the conditional space.},

abstract = {Background: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on developmental fluoride neurotoxicity support the hypothesis that exposure to elevated concentrations of fluoride in water is neurotoxic during development. Methods: We carried out a pilot study of 51 first-grade children in southern Sichuan, China, using the fluoride concentration in morning urine after an exposure-free night; fluoride in well-water source; and dental fluorosis status as indices of past fluoride exposure. We administered a battery of age-appropriate, relatively culture-independent tests that reflect different functional domains: the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-IV) digit span and block design; finger tapping and grooved pegboard. Confounder-adjusted associations between exposure indicators and test scores were assessed using multiple regression models. Results: Dental fluorosis score was the exposure indicator that had the strongest association with the outcome deficits, and the WISC-IV digit span subtest appeared to be the most sensitive outcome, where moderate and severe fluorosis was associated with a digit span total score difference of - 4.28 (95{\%} CI - 8.22, - 0.33) and backward score with - 2.13 (95{\%} CI - 4.24, - 0.02). Conclusions: This pilot study in a community with stable lifetime fluoride exposures supports the notion that fluoride in drinking water may produce developmental neurotoxicity, and that the dose-dependence underlying this relationship needs to be characterized in detail.},

Our approach made use of sibling comparisons to estimate the relationship between birth weight, cognitive development, and timely high school completion in models that spanned childhood, adolescence, and into early adulthood. Our findings indicated that lower birth weight, even after adjusting for fixed-family characteristics and aspects of the home environment that varied between siblings, was associated with decreased cognitive skills at age 5 and marginally significantly slower growth rates into adolescence. In addition, low birth weight increased the risk of not graduating by age 19, although this relationship reflected differences in cognitive development. Additional moderation analyses provided no evidence that birth weight effects are exacerbated by social conditions. Overall, the pattern of findings painted a complex picture of disadvantage, beginning in the womb and presumably via educational attainment, extending over the life course. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: International infant mortality rates vary widely. This variation has been attributed to many factors, including differential reporting. In the US, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN), who generally have low socioeconomic status, have a low neonatal mortality rate. One possible explanation is underregistration of very low birthweight (VLBW, {\textless} 1,500 g) births. We hypothesized that underregistration may occur disproportionately among AI/AN residing on or near reservations (areas controlled by an American Indian group). We estimated infant mortality in these areas. METHODS: Linked birth-infant death files for 1989-1991 were used to compare VLBW and neonatal mortality among AI/AN infants in counties with reservations with those in non-reservation counties. The VLBW rates for non-reservation counties were applied to the reservation risk distribution to calculate directly adjusted VLBW and neonatal mortality rates for reservation counties. This method assumes that greater registration in non-reservation counties yields a more accurate estimate of the relationship between risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Despite a higher prevalence in reservation counties of risk factors, the reported VLBW rate was 0.84{\%} in reservation and 1.17{\%} in non-reservation counties. The neonatal mortality rate was 5.4 per 1,000 in reservation counties and 6.0 in non-reservation counties. Direct adjustment yielded a VLBW rate of 1.28{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.14-1.39) and a neonatal mortality rate of 6.7-9.8 per 1,000 in reservation counties. CONCLUSIONS: Reported neonatal mortality among AI/AN may understate the true rate due to underregistration of VLBW births. Direct adjustment may be useful in estimating infant mortality rates for populations with incomplete vital registration.},

abstract = {Chromatin structure is epigenetically altered via covalent modifications of histones to allow for heritable gene regulation without altering the nucleotide sequence. Multiple lines of evidence from rodents have established a role for epigenetic remodeling in regulating gene transcription in response to an altered gestational milieu. However, to date, it is unknown whether variations in the intrauterine environment in primates similarly induce changes in key determinants of hepatic chromatin structure. We hypothesized that a maternal high-fat diet would alter the epigenomic profile of the developing offspring, which would result in alterations in fetal gene expression. Age- and weight-matched adult female Japanese macaques were placed on control (13{\%} fat) or high-fat (35{\%} fat) breeder diets and mated annually over a 4-year interval. Fetuses in successive years were delivered near term (e130 of 167 days) and underwent necropsy with tissue harvest. Fetal histones were acid extracted for characterization of H3 modification and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with differential display PCR; fetal RNA, DNA, and cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were similarly extracted for comparison. Chronic consumption of a maternal high-fat diet results in a threefold increase in fetal liver triglycerides and histologic correlates of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These gross changes in the fetal liver are accompanied by a statistically significant hyperacetylation of fetal hepatic tissue at H3K14 (199.85+/-9.64 vs 88.8+/-45.4; P=0.038) with a trend towards the increased acetylation at H3K9 (140.9+/-38.7 vs 46.6+/-6.53; P=0.097) and at H3K18 (69.0+/-3.54 vs 58.0+/-4.04; P=0.096). However, epigenetic modifications on fetal hepatic H3 associated with gene repression were absent or subtle (P{\textgreater}0.05). Subsequent characterization of key epigenetic determinants associated with H3 acetylation marks revealed similar significant alterations in association with a high-fat maternal diet (e.g., relative fetal histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) gene expression 0.61+/-0.25; P=0.011). Consistent with our mRNA expression profile, fetal nuclear extracts from offspring of high-fat diet animals were observed to be significantly relatively deplete of HDAC1 protein (36.07+/-6.73 vs 83.18+/-7.51; P=0.006) and in vitro HDAC functional activity (0.252+/-0.03 vs 0.698+/-0.02; P{\textless}0.001). We employ these observations in ChIP differential display PCR to attempt to identify potential fetal genes whose expression is reprogramed under conditions of a high-fat maternal diet. We quantitatively confirm a minimum of a 40{\%} alteration in the expression of several genes of interest: glutamic pyruvate transaminase (alanine aminotransferase) 2 (GPT2) (1.59+/-0.23-fold; P=0.08), DNAJA2 (1.36+/-0.21; P=0.09), and Rdh12 (1.88+/-0.15; P=0.01) are appreciably increased in fetal hepatic tissue from maternal caloric-dense diet animals when compared with control while Npas2, a peripheral circadian regulator, was significantly downmodulated in the offspring of high-fat diet animals (0.66+/-0.08; P=0.03). In this study, we show that a current significant in utero exposure (caloric-dense high-fat maternal diet) induces site-specific alterations in fetal hepatic H3 acetylation. Employing ChIP, we extend these observations to link modifications of H3 acetylation with alterations in gene-specific expression. These results suggest that a caloric-dense maternal diet leading to obesity epigenetically alters fetal chromatin structure in primates via covalent modifications of histones and hence lends a molecular basis to the fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis.},

The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To deal with the causal relationship between corporal punishment and antisocial behavior (ASB) by considering the level of ASB of the child at the start of the study. METHODS: Data from interviews with a national sample of 807 mothers of children aged 6 to 9 years in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Supplement. Analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis that when parents use corporal punishment to correct ASB, it increases subsequent ASB. The analysis controlled for the level of ASB at the start of the study, family socio-economic status, sex of the child, and the extent to which the home provided emotional support and cognitive stimulation. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of the mothers reported spanking their children during the week prior to the study and they spanked them an average of 2.1 times that week. The more spanking at the start of the period, the higher the level of ASB 2 years later. The change is unlikely to be owing to the child's tendency toward ASB or to confounding with demographic characteristics or with parental deficiency in other key aspects of socialization because those variables were statistically controlled. CONCLUSIONS: When parents use corporal punishment to reduce ASB, the long-term effect tends to be the opposite. The findings suggest that if parents replace corporal punishment by nonviolent modes of discipline, it could reduce the risk of ASB among children and reduce the level of violence in American society.},

abstract = {Birthweight is one of the most accessible and most misunderstood variables in epidemiology. A baby's weight at birth is strongly associated with mortality risk during the first year and, to a lesser degree, with developmental problems in childhood and the risk of various diseases in adulthood. Epidemiological analyses often regard birthweight as on the causal pathway to these health outcomes. Under this assumption of causality, birthweight is used to explain variations in infant mortality and later morbidity, and is also used as an intermediate health endpoint in itself. Evidence presented here suggests the link between birthweight and health outcomes may not be causal. Methods of analysis that assume causality are unreliable at best, and biased at worst. The category of 'low birthweight' in particular is uninformative and seldom justified. The main utility of the birthweight distribution is to provide an estimate of the proportion of small preterm births in a population (although even this requires special analytical methods). While the ordinary approaches to birthweight are not well grounded, the links between birthweight and a range of health outcomes may nonetheless reflect the workings of biological mechanisms with implications for human health.},

“The main utility of the birthweight distribution is to provide an estimate of the proportion of small preterm births in a population{\ldots}. While the ordinary approaches to birthweight are not well grounded, the links between birthweight and a range of health outcomes may nonetheless reflect the workings of biological mechanisms with implications for human health.”


“birthweight is an extremely powerful predictor of an individual baby's survival.”

“on a population level, mean birthweight is associated with infant mortality.”

“Finally, birthweight is associated with health outcomes later in life.”

“questions the causal role of birthweight”

“The LBW paradox is not unique to smoking. It is also found among babies born at high altitude compared to low altitude, African-American babies compared with white babies, twins compared with singletons, US births compared with white babies, twins comared with singletons, US births compared with Norweigian biths, and many other examples.”

“This residual comprises all births in the lower tail of the curve that falls outside the predominant distribution. In a typical population, 2 to 5{\%} of births are in the residual distribution.”

 

“The predominant distribution and the residual distribution of birthweight provide indirect information about aspects of gestational age without actually requiring gestational-wge data”

 

“The predominant and residual distributions of birthweight are independent of one another. And exposure that affects fetal growth does not necessarily affect the risk of preterm delivery. (The mean of the predominant distribution can change without affecting the per cent of births in the residual distribution.) Conversely, a factor that increases the risk of preterm delivery would not necessarily change the average weight of babies delivered at term. (The per cent in the residual distribution can change without affecting the predominant distribution.)”

 

“a population with more babies in the residual distribution will have higher infant mortality (all else being equal). In contrast, if two populaitons of babies have different predominant distributions, there is no predictable difference in their infant mortality.”

 

“LBW is easily affected by changes in the predominant distribution which are not reliable indicators of risk.”

 

“The proportion of preterm births in the population should be examined directly whenever possible. The residual distribution of birthweight is informative, but it is not as could as actual information on preterm delivery. (This of course assumes that the gestational data are of good quality, which is not always the case.) Once the per cent of preterm births is known, the analysis of birthweight can be simplified by restricting the sample to term births. Among term births, the influence of gestational age is minor and can be ignored. The mean and SD of birthweights among term births provide a way to compare fetal growth across groups. The comparison of fetal growth patterns may be interesting in its own right (for example, in understanding the biological effect of a specific exposure},

abstract = {Case series of infants with certain birth defect patterns and putative teratogenic exposures should be interpreted with caution since the presence of birth defects and the exposure among the same infants could be entirely due to chance. In the absence of other epidemiologic data, the plausibility for a causal association is strengthened by 1) rarity of the defect pattern, 2) rarity of the exposure in the population, 3) small source population, 4) short time period for the study, and 5) biologic plausibility for the association. These concepts are illustrated using case reports of putative teratogenicity of cocaine and etretinate. In the presence of epidemiologic data, the concept of attributable fraction in exposed (AFE) can be used to evaluate the likelihood that the defect pattern among infants with a particular exposure is attributable to the exposure. This quantity is related to the strength of the epidemiologic association between the defect pattern and the exposure, as measured in terms of relative risk R (or odds ratio), and is equal to (R - 1)/R. Even for strong teratogens such as maternal diabetes and isotretinoin, where R is about 7, in more than 14{\%} (1-AFE) of exposed infants with birth defects, the pattern of defects is not attributable to the exposure. Furthermore, AFE can be used to 'correct' crude measures of sensitivity (the proportion of exposed malformed infants with a defect pattern attributable to the exposure) and positive predictive value (the proportion of malformed infants who have the exposure and have the defect pattern attributable to the exposure). These concepts can be useful adjuncts to the quantitative evaluation of patterns of birth defects associated with suspected human teratogens.},

Among several mechanisms proposed are the following: (1) acidic shift in pH; (2) toxicity of ketoacids; and (3) toxicity of ammonia. (54) The cause of the behavior deficits observed in this study is difficult to explain by any of the foregoing proposed mechanisms, since the degree of ketonuria present in the majority of cases was trivial when viewed in teh light of clinically evident ketoacidosis.... In this context, it is possible that loss of amino acids used for ketoacid production may diminish the supply of amino acids available to the fetus for cerebral development."},

A total of 72 180 Japanese men and women free from cardiovascular diseases and cancers at baseline in 1988 to 1990 were followed up until December 31, 2009. Lifestyles including multivitamin use were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of total stroke and its subtypes in relation to multivitamin use. During a median follow-up of 19.1 years, we identified 2087 deaths from stroke, including 1148 ischemic strokes and 877 hemorrhagic strokes. After adjustment for potential confounders, multivitamin use was associated with lower but borderline significant risk of death from total stroke (HR, 0.87; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.76-1.01), primarily ischemic stroke (HR, 0.80; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.63-1.01), but not hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 0.96; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.78-1.18).

abstract = {We consider studies of cohorts of individuals after a critical event, such as an injury, with the following characteristics. First, the studies are designed to measure "input" variables, which describe the period before the critical event, and to characterize the distribution of the input variables in the cohort. Second, the studies are designed to measure "output" variables, primarily mortality after the critical event, and to characterize the predictive (conditional) distribution of mortality given the input variables in the cohort. Such studies often possess the complication that the input data are missing for those who die shortly after the critical event because the data collection takes place after the event. Standard methods of dealing with the missing inputs, such as imputation or weighting methods based on an assumption of ignorable missingness, are known to be generally invalid when the missingness of inputs is nonignorable, that is, when the distribution of the inputs is different between those who die and those who live. To address this issue, we propose a novel design that obtains and uses information on an additional key variable-a treatment or externally controlled variable, which if set at its "effective" level, could have prevented the death of those who died. We show that the new design can be used to draw valid inferences for the marginal distribution of inputs in the entire cohort, and for the conditional distribution of mortality given the inputs, also in the entire cohort, even under nonignorable missingness. The crucial framework that we use is principal stratification based on the potential outcomes, here mortality under both levels of treatment. We also show using illustrative preliminary injury data that our approach can reveal results that are more reasonable than the results of standard methods, in relatively dramatic ways. Thus, our approach suggests that the routine collection of data on variables that could be used as possible treatments in such studies of inputs and mortality should become common.},

Advances in screening methods have improved the early diagnosis, prognosis, and survival for some cancers. Several validated biomarkers are currently used to diagnose and monitor the progression of cancer, but none of them shows adequate specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value for population screening. So, there is an urgent need to isolate novel sensitive, specific biomarkers to detect the disease early and improve prognosis, especially in high-mortality tumors. Proteomic techniques are powerful tools to help in diagnosis and monitoring of treatment and progression of the disease. During the last decade, mass spectrometry has assumed a key role in most of the proteomic analyses that are focused on identifying cancer biomarkers in human serum, making it possible to identify and characterize at the molecular level many proteins or peptides differentially expressed. In this paper we summarize the results of mass spectrometry serum profiling and biomarker identification in high mortality tumors, such as ovarian, liver, lung, and pancreatic cancer.},

Main outcomes included rates, risk differences, and relative risks of neonatal, postneonatal, and overall infant death.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates for FN infants showed a steady decline in rural areas but a rise-and-fall pattern in urban areas. Relative risks for overall infant death among FN versus non-FN infants declined steadily from 2.75 (95{\%} CI: 2.04, 3.72) to 1.87 (95{\%} CI: 1.24, 2.81) in rural areas from 1981-1984 to 1997-2000, but rose from 1.59 (95{\%} CI: 1.27, 1.99) (1981-1984) to 2.80 (2.33-3.37) (1989-92) and then fell to 1.89 (1.44-2.49) (1997-2000) in urban areas. Risk differences for neonatal death among FN versus non-FN infants declined substantially over time in rural but not urban areas. The disparities in neonatal death among FN versus non-FN were largely explained by differences in preterm birth, while the disparities in postneonatal death were not explained by observed maternal and pregnancy characteristics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Reductions in disparities in infant mortality among FN versus non-FN women have been less substantial and consistent over time in urban versus rural areas of British Columbia, suggesting the need for greater attention to FN maternal and infant health in urban areas.},

After reviewing previous evidence, we present a conceptual framework that highlights data limitations and methodological problems that complicate the study of this topic. We then present estimates of the associations between height and a range of outcomes--including schooling, employment, earnings, health, and cognitive ability--measured in five data sets from early to late adulthood. These results indicate that, on average, taller individuals attain higher levels of education. Height is also positively associated with better economic, health, and cognitive outcomes. These associations are only partially explained by the higher average educational attainment of taller individuals. We then use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adults survey to document the associations between health, cognitive development, and growth in childhood. Even among children with the same mother, taller siblings score better on cognitive tests and progress through school more quickly. Part of the differences found between siblings arises from differences in their birth weights and lengths attributable to mother's behaviors while pregnant. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that childhood health influences health and economic status throughout adulthood.},

These methods provide an alternative to the parsimony-oriented approach of frequentist regression analysis. In particular, they replace arbitrary variable-selection criteria by prior distributions, and by doing so facilitate realistic use of imprecise but important prior information. They also allow Bayesian analyses to be conducted using standard regression packages; one need only be able to add variables and records to the data set. The methods thus facilitate the use of Bayesian solutions to problems of sparse data, multiple comparisons, subgroup analyses and study bias. Because these solutions have a frequentist interpretation as "shrinkage" (penalized) estimators, the methods can also be viewed as a means of implementing shrinkage approaches to multiparameter problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD), a widespread environmental contaminant, disrupts multiple endocrine pathways. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified TCDD as a known human carcinogen, based on predominantly male occupational studies of increased mortality from all cancers combined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: After a chemical explosion on 10 July 1976 in Seveso, Italy, residents experienced some of the highest levels of TCDD exposure in a human population. In 1996, we initiated the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS), a retrospective cohort study of the reproductive health of the women. We previously reported a significant increased risk for breast cancer and a nonsignificant increased risk for all cancers combined with individual serum TCDD, but the cohort averaged only 40 years of age in 1996. Herein we report results for risk of cancer from a subsequent follow-up of the cohort in 2008.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In 1996, we enrolled 981 women who were 0-40 years of age in 1976, lived in the most contaminated areas, and had archived sera collected near the explosion. Individual TCDD concentration was measured in archived serum by high-resolution mass spectrometry. A total of 833 women participated in the 2008 follow-up study. We examined the relation of serum TCDD with cancer incidence using Cox proportional hazards models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 66 (6.7{\%}) women had been diagnosed with cancer. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) associated with a 10-fold increase in serum TCDD for all cancers combined was significantly increased [adjusted HR = 1.80; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.29, 2.52]. For breast cancer, the HR was increased, but not significantly (adjusted HR = 1.44; 95{\%} CI: 0.89, 2.33).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Individual serum TCDD is significantly positively related with all cancer incidence in the SWHS cohort, more than 30 years later. This all-female study adds to the epidemiologic evidence that TCDD is a multisite carcinogen.},

abstract = {The authors evaluated the role of selection bias in the 1999 Canadian case-control study of residential magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia. They included cases, participating controls, and first-choice nonparticipating controls in their analyses. Exposure was assessed by wire coding, a classification system based on the distribution line characteristics near homes. Although an imperfect measure of magnetic field exposure, wire coding is the only method applicable to nonparticipating subjects. First-choice nonparticipant controls tended to be of lower socioeconomic status than their replacements (non-first-choice participant controls), and lower socioeconomic status was related to higher wire code categories. The odds ratios for developing childhood leukemia in the highest exposure category were 1.6 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.0, 2.6) when the actual participating controls were used and 1.3 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.8, 2.1) when the first-choice ideal controls were used, regardless of their participation. Overall, the authors conclude that, although there is some evidence for control selection or participation bias in the Canadian study, it is unlikely to explain entirely the observed association between magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia. Inherent problems in exposure assessment for nonparticipating subjects, however, limit the interpretations of these results, and the role of selection bias cannot entirely be dismissed on the basis of these results alone.},

abstract = {This study applied nonparametric loess regression to describe the predictive association between birth weight and cognitive ability in childhood and generalized propensity score methods to control the confounding of multiple covariates that summarize prenatal differences. The data from wave one of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979-Children (NLSY-C) and the data from wave one of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement (PSID-CDS) were analyzed in parallel and the results were compared. Analysis of the two datasets proceeded in two stages. At the first stage, the association between birth weight and cognitive ability was examined first using loess regression models in which both birth weight and gestational age were the predictors, and then by simple loess regression models in which birth weight was the sole predictor while gestational age was restricted to the normal range, i.e., between 37 complete weeks (259 days) and 42 complete weeks (294 days) to help control its confounding effects. The association was examined separately for subsamples defined by race and sex. At the second stage, the distribution of birth weight was broken into low, medium, and high, and the challenge of controlling multiple covariates was addressed by stratifying the three groups on the balancing score estimated from generalized propensity score models that can accommodate more than two groups. The shape of the association between birth weight and cognitive ability as depicted by loess regression was not consistent across the two datasets. Among the children in the NLSY-C who were born near term and with normal birth weights, the association had an upside-down U-shape. Among the children in the PSID-CDS who were born near term and with normal birth weights, the association was roughly a continuously increasing one. The shape of the association persisted, and was slightly strengthened when multiple covariates that account for prenatal differences were controlled by balancing score-based stratification. Results from the two data sets demonstrated consistent racial and gender differences. The association was stronger for whites than for blacks. White males had slightly higher cognitive scores than white females, while black females had slightly higher scores than black males. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Mediation analysis examines the influence of intermediate factors in the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome. It yields estimates of the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome and of the indirect effect through the intermediate variable. Both esti- mates can be biased if the relationship between the mediator and the outcome is confounded. In this article, we study the effect of unmeasured confounding on direct and indirect effect estimates for a continuous mediator and an outcome that may be either binary, count, or continuous. We formulate the effect of the confounder on the intermediate and on the outcome directly in regression mod- els, which makes the formulas intuitive to use by applied users. The formulas are derived under the assumption that the confounder follows a normal distribution. In simulations, the formulas for a lin- ear response model performed well, also as it did when the unmea- sured confounder was binary. For a rare binary outcome, the formulas for logistic regression performed well if the unmeasured confounder followed a normal distribution, but for a binary confounder the bias in the direct effect was overcorrected. We applied the formulas to data from a case–control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. This showed that unmeasured con- founding can severely bias the estimates of direct and indirect effects.},

abstract = {Excessive gestational weight gain and obesity have been recognized as independent risk factors for maternal and fetal complications of pregnancy with significant lifelong consequences. These associations call into question the recently released Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain recommendations, particularly for obese women. The IOM recommendation of a single standard of weight gain for all obesity classes is also of concern, because higher body mass index levels are associated with more severe pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The IOM recommendations retained the 1990 focus on the theoretical association between poor gestational weight gain and low birth weight (LBW). Low gestational weight gain may often be a consequence and not the cause of LBW, and there is a lack of evidence in developed countries that dietary supplementation increases birth weight. Current obstetric practice allows for accurate and timely diagnosis of and intervention for LBW. We submit that gestational weight gain recommendations should be more individualized especially for obese women. Obese pregnant women should not be precluded from partaking in healthy lifestyle modifications in pregnancy that include physical activities, modified, judicious diets, and limited weight gain.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of grandparental and parental education and parental educational trajectory on their adult offspring's overweight/obesity. We used register data from the Uppsala Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, based on a representative cohort born in Sweden 1915-1929 (G1). Our sample included 5122 women and 11,204 men who were grandchildren of G1 (G3), their parents (G2), and grandparents. G3's overweight/obesity (BMI ???25kg/m2) was based on pre-pregnancy weight/height for women before their first birth (average age=26 years), and measured weight/height at conscription for men (average age=18 years). G1's, G2's, and G3's highest educational attainment was obtained from routine registers and classified as low, intermediate, or high based on respective sample distributions. Parental (G2) educational trajectory was defined as change in education between their own and their highest educated parent (G1), classified into 5 categories: always advantaged (AA), upward trajectory (UT), stable-intermediate (SI), downward trajectory (DT), and always disadvantaged (AD). We used hierarchical gender-stratified logistic regression models adjusted for G3's age, education, year of BMI collection, lineage and G2's year of birth and income. Grandparental and parental education were negatively associated with men's odds of overweight/obesity and parental education affected women's overweight/obesity risk. Furthermore, men and women whose parents belonged to the UT, SI, DT, and AD groups had greater odds of overweight/obesity compared to men and women whose parents belonged to the AA group (adjusted for G3's age, year of BMI collection, lineage, and G2's year of birth). These associations were attenuated when further adjusting for parental income and G3's own education. Socioeconomic inequalities can have long-term consequences and impact the health of future generations. For overweight/obesity in concurrent young cohorts, this inequality is not fully offset by upward educational trajectory in their parent's generation.},

After weaning, male progeny were placed on a chow diet until 8 weeks old, and then segregated into HFD or CD groups. At 20 weeks old, rats were evaluated in the Morris water maze, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were documented in the brain. In comparison to rats fed CD, cognitive decline in HFD progeny from HFD dams manifested as a decline in retention, but not acquisition, in the water maze. HFD was also associated with significant increases in 3-nitrotyrosine, inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-6, and glial markers Iba-1 and GFAP, with the largest increases frequently observed in HFD animals born to HFD dams. Thus, these data collectively suggest that HFD increases oxidative and inflammatory signaling in the brain, and further indicate that maternal HFD consumption might sensitize offspring to the detrimental effects of HFD.},

abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) superfamily of transcription factors, mediates toxic response induced by environmental chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). AhR is expressed at high levels in several human breast carcinoma cell lines in direct correlation with the degree of their malignancy. Recent studies suggest a possible role for AhR in cancer independent of PAH. Therefore, we established stable AhR knockdown cells of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and analyzed their tumorigenic properties in in vitro and in vivo model systems. In addition we analyzed their response to radiation and chemotherapeutic treatment. AhR knockdown attenuated these cells tumorigenic properties in vitro including proliferation, anchorage independent growth, migration and apoptosis and reduced orthotopic xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Notably, we observed that AhR knockdown enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis as well as significantly decreased cell clonogenic survival. Furthermore, AhR knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells sensitized them to paclitaxel treatment, evident by a decrease in the required cytotoxic dose. Subsequent analysis revealed AhR knockdown significantly reduced phosphorylation of AKT, which impacts cell proliferation and survival. Apoptosis-focused gene expression analyses revealed an altered expression of genes regulating apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our data identify AhR as a potential novel therapeutic target in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.},

abstract = {The use of propensity scores to adjust for measured confounding factors has become increasingly popular in cohort studies. However, their use in case-control and case-cohort studies has received little attention. The authors present some theory on the estimation and use of propensity scores in case-control and case-cohort studies and present the results of simulation studies that examine whether large-sample expectations are realized in studies of typical size. The application of propensity scores is less straightforward in case-control and case-cohort studies than in cohort studies. The authors' simulations revealed two potentially important issues. First, when using several potential approaches, there is artifactual effect modification of the odds ratio by level of propensity score. The magnitude of this phenomenon decreases as the sample size increases. Second, several potential approaches produce estimated propensity scores that do not converge to the true value as sample size increases and, thus, can fail to adjust fully for measured confounding factors. However, the magnitude of residual confounding appeared modest in our simulations. Researchers considering using propensity scores in case-control or case-cohort studies should consider the potential for artifactual effect modification and their reduced ability to control for potential confounding factors.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is useful in assessing how robust an associa- tion is to potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding. This article introduces a new measure called the “E-value,” which is related to the evidence for causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding. The E-value is de- fined as the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a spe- cific treatment–outcome association, conditional on the mea- sured covariates. A large E-value implies that considerable un- measured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. A small E-value implies little unmeasured con- founding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. The authors propose that in all observational studies intended to produce evidence for causality, the E-value be reported or some other sensitivity analysis be used. They suggest calculating the E-value for both the observed association estimate (after adjust- ments for measured confounders) and the limit of the confi- dence interval closest to the null. If this were to become standard practice, the ability of the scientific community to assess evi- dence from observational studies would improve considerably, and ultimately, science would be strengthened.},

abstract = {Objectives: To identify demographic risk factors for either birthweight {\textgreater}4kg or over the 90th centile and to quantify the obstetric risks. Study design: Data from 350,311 completed singleton pregnancies in the North West Thames Region between 1988 and 1997 were analysed using logistic regression. Predisposing factors and pregnancy outcome were compared by birthweight 2.5-4kg (n=259,902) and {\textgreater}4kg (n=36,462) and 10th-90th centile (n=279,780) and {\textgreater}90th centile (n=34,937). Results: Macrosomia defined as birthweight {\textgreater}90th centile was more likely in women whose BMI {\textgreater}30 (kg/m2) (odds ratio (OR) 2.08; confidence intervals (CI) 1.99, 2.17), parity {\textgreater}4 (OR 2.20; CI 2.02, 2.40), age {\textgreater}40 (OR 1.22; CI 1.11, 1.35) and in women with pre-existing diabetes (OR 6.97; CI 5.36, 8.16) or who developed gestational diabetes (OR 2.77; CI 2.51, 3.07). Macrosomia defined by birthweight {\textgreater}4kg was better than birthweight {\textgreater}90th centile at predicting morbidity and was associated with a prolonged first and second stage of labour (OR 1.57; CI 1.51, 1.63) and (OR 2.03; CI 1.88, 2.19), respectively, an increased risk of instrumental vaginal delivery (OR 1.76; CI 1.68, 1.85), third degree perineal trauma (OR 2.73; CI 2.30, 3.23), emergency caesarean section (OR 1.84; CI 1.75, 1.93), postpartum haemorrhage (OR 2.01; CI 1.93, 2.10), Apgar score {\textless}4 (OR 1.35; CI 1.03, 1.76), and admission to the special care baby unit (OR 1.51; CI 21.38, 1.68). Conclusion: Macrosomia is more common in mothers who are obese, older or diabetic and is associated with significant obstetric morbidity. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Evidence shows that dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) can increase the incidence and severity of the disease in monkeys and can promote the growth or survival of endometrial tissue implanted into rodents in a surgically induced model of endometriosis. The mechanism of the connection between organochlorine chemicals and endometriosis is not clear. Effects on growth factors, cytokines, and hormones (components of the immune and endocrine systems) are potential means of mediating the possible promotion of endometriosis by dioxins. Studies on epidemiology and on structure-activity relationships of organochlorine chemicals and endometriosis have been additional approaches to this problem. In this regard, toxic equivalence (TEQ) appears to be an important determinant of the effects of organochlorine chemicals on endometriosis. In this article, we review the literature related to endometriosis and dioxins and attempt to integrate the various sources of information that bolster the hypothesis connecting dioxins and endometriosis.},

abstract = {One misconception (of many) about Bayesian analyses is that prior distributions introduce assumptions that are more questionable than assumptions made by frequentist methods; yet the assumptions in priors can be more reasonable than the assumptions implicit in standard frequentist models. Another misconception is that Bayesian methods are computationally difficult and require special software. But perfectly adequate Bayesian analyses can be carried out with common software for frequentist analysis. Under a wide range of priors, the accuracy of these approximations is just as good as the frequentist accuracy of the software--and more than adequate for the inaccurate observational studies found in health and social sciences. An easy way to do Bayesian analyses is via inverse-variance (information) weighted averaging of the prior with the frequentist estimate. A more general method expresses the prior distributions in the form of prior data or 'data equivalents', which are then entered in the analysis as a new data stratum. That form reveals the strength of the prior judgements being introduced and may lead to tempering of those judgements. It is argued that a criterion for scientific acceptability of a prior distribution is that it be expressible as prior data, so that the strength of prior assumptions can be gauged by how much data they represent.},

@article{Kissin2015,
abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Are assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment factors or infertility diagnoses associated with autism among ART-conceived children?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY ANSWER: Our study suggests that the incidence of autism diagnosis in ART-conceived children during the first 5 years of life was higher when intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was used compared with conventional IVF, and lower when parents had unexplained infertility (among singletons) or tubal factor infertility (among multiples) compared with other types of infertility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Some studies found an increased risk of autism among ART-conceived infants compared with spontaneously-conceived infants. However, few studies, and none in the USA, have examined the associations between types of ART procedures and parental infertility diagnoses with autism among ART-conceived children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Population-based retrospective cohort study using linkages between National ART Surveillance System (NASS) data for 1996-2006, California Birth Certificate data for 1997-2006, and California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) Autism Caseload data for 1997-2011.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All live born ART-conceived infants born in California in 1997-2006 (n = 42 383) with 5-year observation period were included in the study. We assessed the annual incidence of autism diagnosis documented in DDS, which includes information on the vast majority of persons with autism in California, and the association of autism diagnosis with ART treatment factors and infertility diagnoses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among ART-conceived singletons born in California between 1997 and 2006, the incidence of autism diagnosis remained at ∼0.8{\%} (P for trend 0.19) and was lower with parental diagnosis of unexplained infertility (adjusted hazard risk ratio [aHRR]; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.38; 0.15-0.94) and higher when ICSI was used (aHRR 1.65; 1.08-2.52), when compared with cases without these patient and treatment characteristics. Among ART-conceived multiples, the incidence of autism diagnosis between 1997 and 2006 remained at ∼1.2{\%} (P for trend 0.93) and was lower with parental diagnosis of tubal factor infertility (aHRR 0.56; 0.35-0.90) and higher when ICSI was used (aHRR 1.71; 1.10-2.66).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Study limitations include imperfect data linkages, lack of data on embryo quality and possible underestimation of autism diagnosis cases. Limitations of the observational study design could affect the analysis by the possibility of residual confounders. Since information about ICSI use was missing for most frozen/thawed embryo transfer cycles, our findings of association of ICSI use and autism diagnosis can only be generalizable to fresh embryo transfer cycles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study provides additional evidence of the association between some types of ART procedures with autism diagnosis. Additional research is required to explain the increased risk of autism diagnosis with ICSI use, as well as studies on the effectiveness and safety of ICSI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study was partially supported by the National Institutes of Health.

So-called controlled direct effects (CDE) assess the effect of the exposure on an outcome with the intermediate fixed to a particular level. So-called natural direct effects (NDE) and natural indirect effects (NIE) allow for the decomposition of a total effect (TE) into direct and indirect effect components. (3-5)... When both direct and indirect effects are employed, a measure of the "proportion mediated" (PM) is sometimes calculated as the ratio of the natural indirect effect to the total effect.... This measure in some sense captures how important the pathway through the intermediate is in explaining the actual operation of the effect of the exposure on the outcome. It measures what would happen to the effect of the exposure on the outcome IF WE WERE TO SOMEHOW DISABLE THE PATHWAY FROM THE EXPOSURE TO THE INTERMEDIATE."


"they require, for each person, fixing the mediator to the counterfactual level the person would have had in the absence of exposure). Such effect estimates do not correspond to actual interventiosn we could carry out in practice, and are thus of limited interest from a policy perspective."

"An alternative proportion measure may be of more interest in policy settings. The controlled direct effect fixing the intermediate to level M = m, CDE(m), captures the effect of the exposure on the outcome if the intermediate were set, possibly contrary to fact, to level m. This is an intervention we might hope to be able to carry out in practice.... carry out in practice... We might hope that by intervening on the intermediate we could block a substantial part of the effect of the exposure on the outcome. A proportion measure that could then be used, and that would be of policy relevance, would be the proportion of the effect of the exposure on the outcome that could be eliminated by intervening to set the intermediate to some fixed level m. This would be [TE-CDE(m)]/TE. If this proportion eliminated were large we might try to implement policies to intervene on the intermediate."

The proportion mediated essentially captures what would happen to the effect of the exposure if we were to somehow disable the pathway from the exposure to the intermediate (leaving it to its natural value); in contrast the proportion eliminated measure captures what would happen to the effect of the exposure on the outcome if we were to fix the intermediate to the same fixed value M=m for all persons.},

abstract = {This article examined emotion competence in children exposed to domestic violence (DV). It also examined the hypothesis that children's emotional competence mediates relations between DV and children's later difficulties with peers and behavioral adjustment. DV was assessed when children were at the age of five, emotional competence was assessed at the age of 9.5, and peer quality and behavioral adjustment were obtained at the age of 11. Children from homes with greater DV were less aware of their own emotions and more emotionally dysregulated at the age of 9.5. Emotional awareness mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's friendship closeness and internalizing problems at the age of 11. Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's negative peer group interactions, social problems, and internalizing and externalizing problems at the age of 11. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of DV on children's emotional development and the role that different aspects of emotional competence play in children's socio-emotional adjustment.

abstract = {While the effects of low birth weight have long been explored, those of high birth weight have been essentially ignored. Economists have analyzed the negative effects that low birth weight might have on subsequent school outcomes, while taking into account unobserved characteristics that may be common to families with low birth weight babies and negative outcomes in terms of school test scores when children, in addition to labor market income when adults. Today, however, with increasing obesity rates in the United States, high birth weight has become a potential concern, and has been associated in the medical literature with an increased likelihood of becoming an overweight child, adolescent, and subsequently an obese adult. Overweight and obesity, in turn, are associated with a host of negative effects, including lower test scores in school and lower labor market prospects when adults. If studies only focus on low birth weight, they may underestimate the effects of ensuring that mothers receive adequate support during pregnancy. In this study we find that cognitive outcomes are adversely affected not only by low birth weight ({\textless}2500 grams) but also by high birth weight ({\textgreater}4500 grams). Our results have policy implications in terms of provision of support for pregnant women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital cardiac defects is uncertain. In particular, there are concerns about a possible association between paroxetine use and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and between sertraline use and ventricular septal defects. METHODS: We performed a cohort study nested in the nationwide Medicaid Analytic eXtract for the period 2000 through 2007. The study included 949,504 pregnant women who were enrolled in Medicaid during the period from 3 months before the last menstrual period through 1 month after delivery and their liveborn infants. We compared the risk of major cardiac defects among infants born to women who took antidepressants during the first trimester with the risk among infants born to women who did not use antidepressants, with an unadjusted analysis and analyses that restricted the cohort to women with depression and that used propensity-score adjustment to control for depression severity and other potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 64,389 women (6.8{\%}) used antidepressants during the first trimester. Overall, 6403 infants who were not exposed to antidepressants were born with a cardiac defect (72.3 infants with a cardiac defect per 10,000 infants), as compared with 580 infants with exposure (90.1 per 10,000 infants). Associations between antidepressant use and cardiac defects were attenuated with increasing levels of adjustment for confounding. The relative risks of any cardiac defect with the use of SSRIs were 1.25 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.13 to 1.38) in the unadjusted analysis, 1.12 (95{\%} CI, 1.00 to 1.26) in the analysis restricted to women with depression, and 1.06 (95{\%} CI, 0.93 to 1.22) in the fully adjusted analysis restricted to women with depression. We found no significant association between the use of paroxetine and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (relative risk, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.59 to 1.93) or between the use of sertraline and ventricular septal defects (relative risk, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.76 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large, population-based cohort study suggested no substantial increase in the risk of cardiac malformations attributable to antidepressant use during the first trimester.

abstract = {Background: Trastuzumab-a humanised monoclonal antibody against HER2-has been shown to improve disease-free survival after chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. We investigated the drug's effect on overall survival after a median follow-up of 2 years in the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) study. Methods: HERA is an international multicentre randomised trial that compared 1 or 2 years of trastuzumab treatment with observation alone after standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive node positive or high-risk node negative breast cancer. 5102 women participated in the trial; we analysed data from 1703 women who had been randomised for treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year and 1698 women from the control group, with median follow-up of 23{\textperiodcentered}5 months (range 0-48 months). The primary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival. Here, we assess overall survival, a secondary endpoint. Analyses were done on an intent-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2005-002385-11. Findings: 97 (5{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}) patients randomised to observation alone and 58 (3{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}) patients randomised to 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab were lost to follow-up. 172 women stopped trastuzumab prematurely. 59 deaths were reported for trastuzumab and 90 in the control group. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of death with trastuzumab compared with observation alone was 0{\textperiodcentered}66 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}47-0{\textperiodcentered}91; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0115). 218 disease-free survival events were reported with trastuzumab compared with 321 in the control group. The unadjusted HR for the risk of an event with trastuzumab compared with observation alone was 0{\textperiodcentered}64 (0{\textperiodcentered}54-0{\textperiodcentered}76; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Interpretation: Our results show that 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy has a significant overall survival benefit after a median follow-up of 2 years. The emergence of this benefit after only 2 years reinforces the importance of trastuzumab in the treatment of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An association of gestational weight gain (GWG) with offspring cognition has been postulated. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a United Kingdom prospective cohort (1990 through the present) with a median of 10 maternal weight measurements in pregnancy. These were used to allocate participants to 2009 Institute of Medicine weight-gain categories and in random effect linear spline models. Outcomes were School Entry Assessment score (age, 4 years; n = 5,832), standardized intelligence quotient assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (age, 8 years; n = 5,191), and school final-examination results (age, 16 years; n = 7,339). Offspring of women who gained less weight than recommended had a 0.075 standard deviation lower mean School Entry Assessment score (95{\%} confidence interval: -0.127, -0.023) and were less likely to achieve adequate final-examination results (odds ratio = 0.88, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.78, 0.99) compared with offspring of women who gained as recommended. GWG in early pregnancy (defined as 0-18 weeks on the basis of a knot point at 18 weeks) and midpregnancy (defined as 18-28 weeks on the basis of knot points at 18 and 28 weeks) was positively associated with School Entry Assessment score and intelligence quotient. GWG in late pregnancy (defined as 28 weeks onward on the basis of a knot point at 28 weeks) was positively associated with offspring intelligence quotient and with increased odds of offspring achieving adequate final-examination results in mothers who were overweight prepregnancy. Findings support small positive associations between GWG and offspring cognitive development, which may have lasting effects on educational attainment up to age 16 years.},
annote = {"To the best of our knowledge, only 1 previous study has assessed the relationship between GWG and offspring cognition. That study found that offspring of women who gained between 2 and 13 kg during pregnancy scores higher.... than those whose mothers gained less than 2 kg or more than 13 kg, even when adjusting for the motehr's prepregnancy weight/height ratio."


maternal weight gain of less than, as, more than according to 2009 IOM

model 1: gestational age, maternal age, age at outcome assessment, and sex

model 2: the above, as well as prepregnancy BMI, smoking, parity, mode of delivery, and maternal education

no strong evidence for association with gaining more than recommended

lower scores (but not IQ) and edu outcomes with less than recommended, even after adjusting for confounders

We did not find clear evidence that GWG in the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, when the contribution of maternal fat deposition may not be the main driver of associations. In our study, birth weight partially mediated associations of GWG with offspring cognitive outcomes, suggesting that fetal growth is not the main driver of associations."

"Our findings may reflect the association of fetal growth with childhood cognition. Alternatively, the observed association of birth weight with IQ and, here of GWG with cognitive outcomes coudl be attributable to residual confounding and not reflections of a direct intrauterine effect."

no evidence for interaction btw obesity and GWG for scores and IQ, but yes for final exam scores

prepregnancy weight inversely related to all three outcomes},

abstract = {Two important lines of research have enhanced our understanding of the molecular role of nutrition in influencing behavior. First, exposure to an adverse environment during early life can influence the long-term behavior of the offspring. Second, regulation of the nervous system development and functioning appears to involve epigenetic mechanisms that require a continuous supply of methyl group donors in food. We hypothesized that a maternal diet during pregnancy deficient in methyl donors (MDD) may lead to altered behavior in offspring through permanent changes in hippocampal DNA methylation. We used a rat model of prenatal dietary MDD to test this hypothesis in female offspring as they aged. Prenatal MDD reduced birth weight, litter size, and newborn viability. Aged female offspring of MDD mothers showed increased anxiety and increased learning ability in comparison with control diet group offspring. To explore the role of MDD on epigenetic mechanisms in the brain of adult offspring, we studied expression and methylation of 4 selected genes coding for glucocorticoid receptor, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11 type 2, neuronatin, and reelin proteins in the hippocampus. No major group differences in methylation or expression of the studied genes were detected, except for a significant down-regulation of the reelin gene in the MDD female offspring. The prenatal MDD diet caused intrauterine growth restriction, associated with long-term effects on the behavior of the offspring. However, the observed behavioral differences between the MDD and control diet offspring cannot be explained by epigenetic regulation of the specific genes investigated in this study.},

abstract = {I present some extensions of Bayesian methods to situations in which biases are of concern. First, a basic misclassification problem is illustrated using data from a study of sudden infant death syndrome. Bayesian analyses are then given. These analyses can be conducted directly, or by converting actual-data records to incomplete records and prior distributions to complete-data records, then applying missing-data techniques to the augmented data set. The analyses can easily incorporate any complete ('validation' or second-stage) data that might be available, as well as adjustments for confounding and selection bias. The approach illustrates how conventional analyses depend on implicit certainty that bias parameters are null and how these implausible assumptions can be replaced by plausible priors for bias parameters.},

The related terms of ‘bio- markers' and ‘surrogates' are common in pharmacological and biomedical sciences. Sometimes this concept is represented by graphical displays of various kinds. The view here is that there is a great deal of imprecise discussion surroundingthis topic and, moreover, that the most straightforward way to clarify the situation is by usingpotential outcomes to define causal effects. In particular, I suggest that the use of principal stratification is key to understanding the meaning of direct and indirect causal effects.

An important contribution of our study is the use of information on siblings to control for unmeasured factors that may confound estimates of the effect of pregnancy intentions on infant and child outcomes. Results from our study indicate that unwanted pregnancy is associated with prenatal and postpartum maternal behaviors that adversely affect infant and child health, but that unwanted pregnancy has little association with birth weight and child cognitive outcomes. Estimates of the association between unwanted pregnancy and maternal behaviors were greatly reduced after controls for unmeasured family background were included in the model. Our results also indicate that there are no significant differences in maternal behaviors or child outcomes between mistimed and wanted pregnancies.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Endometriosis is histologically characterized by the displacement of endometrial tissue to extrauterine locations including the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, and bowel. An important cause of infertility and pelvic pain, the individual and global socioeconomic burden of endometriosis is significant. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of the condition. However, the invasive nature of surgery, coupled with the lack of a laboratory biomarker for the disease, results in a mean latency of 7–11 years from onset of symptoms to definitive diagnosis. Unfortunately, the delay in diagnosis may have significant consequences in terms of disease progression. The discovery of a sufficiently sensitive and specific biomarker for the nonsurgical detection of endometriosis promises earlier diagnosis and prevention of deleterious sequelae and represents a clear research priority. In this review, we describe and discuss the current status of biomarkers of endometriosis in plasma, urine, and endometrium.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:   Children in the USA are experiencing obesity and overweight at epidemic rates. Schools have started to make policy decisions based on a popularly presumed connection between nutrition and academic achievement. This study aimed to determine whether such a relationship exists, and if so, its nature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:   Data from the Food Consumption Questionnaire administered to approximately 12 000 fifth graders as part of the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort was analysed using regression analysis. The analysis used propensity score matching to examine the relationship between students' reported fast-food consumption and their test scores in reading and mathematics. Propensity score matching attempts to control for a host of background characteristics that might be correlated with both fast-food consumption and test scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:   Standard ordinary least squares regression showed that test scores decreased as reported fast-food consumption increased. In the propensity-score-matched analysis, which controlled for 25 student background characteristics, higher-than-average fast-food consumption ('four to six times in the last 7 days' or more) was associated with significantly lower test scores in both reading (-11.15 points or 0.48 SD) and math (-11.13 points or 0.52 SD), even when teacher experience, school poverty level and school urbanicity were also included in the model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:   Although this study is preliminary, its results indicate that the relationship between poor nutrition and test scores may in fact be quite negative, strengthening the impetus for schools to consider policies that support students' healthy eating. In order to strengthen these findings and investigate possible mechanisms through which poor nutrition might affect test scores, there is a need for further research.},

abstract = {A large literature describes relationships between month of birth, birth weight, and gestation. These relationships are hypothesized to reflect the causal impact of seasonal environmental factors. However, recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes. Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647,050 groups of US siblings representing 1,435,213 children. By following the same mother over time, we eliminate differences in fixed maternal characteristics as an explanation for seasonal differences in health at birth. We find a sharp trough in gestation length among babies conceived in May, which corresponds to an increase in prematurity of more than 10{\%}. Birth weight conditional on gestation length, however, is found to be strongly hump-shaped over the year, with 8-9 additional g for summer conceptions. We examine several potential mechanisms for explaining seasonality in birth outcomes that have generally been dismissed in the literature on seasonality in rich countries, notably disease prevalence and nutrition. The May trough in gestation length coincides with a higher influenza prevalence in January and February, when these babies are nearing full term, whereas the hump shape in birth weight is associated with a similar pattern in pregnancy weight gain.},

A matched case-control study was carried out in three regions of the United Kingdom over the period January 2001 through August 2003. For each case, three liveborn controls were matched by initial intended place of delivery, region, and maternal age. Maternal hair analysis provided independent verification of recreational drug use. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mutually adjusted odds ratios. Estimates were revised using data from hair analysis. Statistically significant adjusted odds ratios for gastroschisis were associated with first-trimester use of 1) any recreational drug (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 4.3) and 2) vasoconstrictive recreational drugs (defined as cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy) (OR = 3.3, 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 10.5). Other significant exposures included aspirin use (OR = 20.4, 95{\%} CI: 2.2, 191.5), cigarette smoking (OR = 1.7, 95{\%} CI: 1.1, 2.6), and prior history of gynecologic infection/disease (OR = 2.6, 95{\%} CI: 1.2, 5.6). Recreational drug use is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis and is one of a constellation of potentially preventable exposures which include cigarette smoking, aspirin use, and history of gynecologic infection/disease. Maternal hair analysis proved an acceptable and valuable method of independently verifying recreational drug use.},

Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be utilized in practice.},

Data were abstracted from vital records (birth certificates) and analyzed using a variety of descriptive statistics. Mothers of Native American and black infants had similar antenatal profiles (that is, younger, higher parity, lower educational attainment, and delayed initiation of prenatal care), which differed from mothers of white or other race infants. Despite having at-risk mothers, Native American infants were similar to white and other race infants with respect to the percentage of births that were considered low birth weight or premature. Black infants were twice as likely as the other three groups of infants to be low birth weight or premature. These findings suggest that other factors appear to be important in determining neonatal outcome and that typical at-risk antenatal profile of mothers may not be consistent across all racial groups.},

abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may affect male reproductive function. Many dioxin-like POPs exert their effects by activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signalling pathway. We analysed whether gene-environment interactions between polymorphisms in AHR (R554K) and AHR repressor (AHRR P185A) and serum levels of markers of POP exposure 1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) are associated with 21 parameters of male reproductive function in 581 proven-fertile European and Greenlandic men. In Greenlandic men, AHR variants significantly modified the association between serum levels of both p,p'-DDE and CB-153 and inhibin B levels, sperm chromatin integrity, and seminal zinc levels. In the total cohort, interactions between AHRR variants and serum levels of CB-153 were associated with sperm chromatin integrity and the expression of the pro-apoptotic marker protein Fas. The data indicate that susceptibility to adverse effects of POP exposure on male reproductive function is dependent on polymorphisms in genes involved in AHR signalling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parental feeding practices are thought to influence children's weight status, through children's eating behavior and nutritional intake. However, because most studies have been cross-sectional, the direction of influence is unclear. Moreover, although obesity rates are high among Latino children, few studies of parental feeding practices have focused on this population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This 2-year longitudinal study examined mutual influences over time between parental feeding practices and children's weight status, in Mexican American families with children 18 years old at baseline. Mothers (n = 322) and fathers (n = 182) reported on their feeding practices at baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up. Weight status, defined by waist-height ratio (WHtR) and body mass index (BMI), was ascertained at all assessments. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine the mutual influences of parental feeding practices and child weight status over time, controlling for covariates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both mothers' and fathers' restriction of food predicted higher subsequent child weight status at Year 1, and for fathers this effect was also found at Year 2. Mothers' and fathers' pressure to eat predicted lower weight status among boys, but not girls, at Year 1. Child weight status also predicted some parental feeding practices: boys' heavier weight predicted mothers' less pressure to eat at Year 1, less use of food to control behavior at Year 2, and greater restriction at Year 2; and girls' heavier weight at Year 1 predicted fathers' less pressure to eat and less positive involvement in child eating at Year 2.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides longitudinal evidence that some parental feeding practices influence Mexican American children's weight status, and that children's weight status also influences some parental feeding practices. Feeding practices of both mothers and fathers were related to children's weight status, underscoring the importance of including fathers in research on parental feeding practices and child obesity.},

abstract = {Background: There is an absence of population-based long-term studies on the risk of neurological sequelae in children born after in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Our aim was to compare the frequency of such problems between IVF-born children and controls. Methods: We did a population-based retrospective cohort study in which we compared development of neurological problems in 5680 children born after IVF, with 11 360 matched controls. For 2060 twins born after IVF, a second set of controls (n=4120), all twins, were selected. We obtained data on neurological problems from the records of the Swedish habilitation centres. Findings: Children born after IVF are more likely to need habilitation services than controls (odds ratio 1.7, 95{\%} CI 1.3-2.2). For singletons, the risk was 1.4 (1.0-2.1). The most common neurological diagnosis was cerebral palsy, for which children born after IVF had an increased risk of 3.7(2.0-6.6), and IVF singletons of 2.8 (1.3-5.8). Suspected developmental delay was increased four-fold (1.9-8.3) in children born after IVF. Twins born after IVF did not differ from control twins with respect to risk of neurological sequelae. Low-birthweight and premature infants were more likely to need habilitation than fullterm babies. Maternal age did not affect risk. Interpretation: Our study suggests that children born after IVF have an increased risk of developing neurological problems, especially cerebral palsy. These risks are largely due to the high frequency of twin pregnancies, low birthweight, and prematurity among babies born after IVF. To limit these risks, we recommend that only one embryo should be transferred during IVF.},

This study evaluates the effects of a community-based approach of PS and FS on growth and development of severely malnourished children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUBJECTS/METHODS: Severely underweight hospitalised children aged 6-24 months (n = 507) were randomly allocated on discharge to five groups: (i) PS, (ii) FS, (iii) PS+FS, (iv) clinic-control and (v) hospital-control. PS included play sessions and parental counselling on child development. This was done at each fortnightly follow-up visit, that is, every second week, for 6 months at community clinics. FS included distribution of cereal-based food packets (150-300 kcal/day) for 3 months. All groups received medical care, micronutrient supplementation, health-education and growth monitoring. Children's development was assessed using revised version of Bayley Scales of Infant Development at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of intervention. Anthropometry was measured using standard procedure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Comparing groups with any stimulation with those with no stimulation there was a significant effect of stimulation on children's mental development index (group*session interaction P = 0.037, effect size = 0.37 s.d.) and weight-for-age Z-score (group*session interaction P = 0.02, effect size=0.26 s.d.). Poor levels of development and nutritional status were sustained, however, due to their initial very severe malnutrition. There was no effect on motor development and linear growth.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Children receiving any stimulation showed a significant benefit to mental development and growth in weight. More intensive intervention with longer duration is needed to correct their poor developmental levels and nutritional status.},

abstract = {We examined the psychosocial maladjustment of 32 children with an incarcerated parent from the child's perspective as well as from the perspective of their caregiver. We focused on the relation between the incarcerated parent's report of children's exposure to parental criminal activity, arrest, and sentencing and caregivers' and children's self-reports of maladjustment. Results indicate that witnessing these events is associated with more behavior problems according to caregivers' and children's self-reports. Moreover, incarcerated parents' reports of children's exposure to these events predicted caregivers' and children's reports of maladjustment over a 6 month period. Our results also suggest that children with incarcerated mothers, in comparison to children with incarcerated fathers, are exposed to more of these events and may be experiencing greater maladjustment. Implications of these findings are discussed within a proactive context and the use of procedures that take children's reactions to witnessing parental arrest and sentencing into consideration.

"Greater adversities during the first 6  years of life were inconsistently associated with illness requiring a doctor, somatic concerns, and any health problem. There was little effect of adversities in the second 6 years of life. However, recent adversities had quite strong effects on poor child health, somatic concerns, and any health problem."
"Exposure to violence and other childhood stress has been associated witha  number of neurobiological and behavioral findings including smaller prefrontal cortex volume, impaired prefrontal cortex functioning, chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, impaired responses to psychosocial stressors, and elevated inflammation levels. Childhood exposure to violence has been linked to gene modifications. Cumulative or chronic exposure to ACEs may lead to allostatic overload, causing neurobiological responses to become pathogenic rather than protective. Excessive, prolonged, or frequent activation of the body's stress-response system may result in toxic stress for the child, leading to long-term health consequences."

abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instruc-tors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past 10 years, research into environmental risk factors for autism has grown dramatically, bringing evidence that an array of non-genetic factors acting during the prenatal period may influence neurodevelopment. METHODS: This paper reviews the evidence on modifiable preconception and/or prenatal factors that have been associated, in some studies, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including nutrition, substance use and exposure to environmental agents. This review is restricted to human studies with at least 50 cases of ASD, having a valid comparison group, conducted within the past decade and focusing on maternal lifestyle or environmental chemicals. RESULTS: Higher maternal intake of certain nutrients and supplements has been associated with reduction in ASD risk, with the strongest evidence for periconceptional folic acid supplements. Although many investigations have suggested no impact of maternal smoking and alcohol use on ASD, more rigorous exposure assessment is needed. A number of studies have demonstrated significant increases in ASD risk with estimated exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period, particularly for heavy metals and particulate matter. Little research has assessed other persistent and non-persistent organic pollutants in association with ASD specifically. CONCLUSIONS: More work is needed to examine fats, vitamins and other maternal nutrients, as well as endocrine-disrupting chemicals and pesticides, in association with ASD, given sound biological plausibility and evidence regarding other neurodevelopmental deficits. The field can be advanced by large-scale epidemiological studies, attention to critical aetiological windows and how these vary by exposure, and use of biomarkers and other means to understand underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Agriculture can be an important engine of growth and poverty reduction. But the sector is underperforming in many countries in part because women, who are often a crucial resource in agriculture and the rural economy, face constraints that reduce their productivity. In this paper we draw on the available empirical evidence to study in which areas and to what degree women participate in agriculture. Aggregate data shows that women comprise about 43 percent of the agricultural labour force globally and in developing countries. But this figure masks considerable variation across regions and within countries according to age and social class. Time use surveys, which are more comprehensive but typically not nationally representative, add further insight into the substantial heterogeneity among countries and within countries in women's contribution to agriculture. They show that female time-use in agriculture varies also by crop, production cycle, age and ethnic group. A few time-use surveys have data by activity and these show that in general weeding and harvesting were predominantly female activities. Overall the labour burden of rural women exceeds that of men, and includes a higher proportion of unpaid household responsibilities related to preparing food and collecting fuel and water. The contribution of women to agricultural and food production is significant but it is impossible to verify empirically the share produced by women. Women's participation in rural labour markets varies considerably across regions, but invariably women are over represented in unpaid, seasonal and part-time work, and the available evidence suggests that women are often paid less than men, for the same work. Available data on rural and agricultural feminization shows that this is not a general trend but mainly a sub-Saharan Africa phenomena, as well as observed in some sectors such as unskilled labour in the fruit, vegetable and cut-flower export sector. This paper re-affirms that women make essential contributions to agriculture and rural enterprises across the developing world. But there is much diversity in women's roles and over-generalization undermines policy relevance and planning. The context is important and policies must be based on sound data and gender analysis.},

Additionally, there is increasing prevalence of obesity in other industrialised areas of the world such as Europe. Of potentially more concern is the potential risks associated with obesity and related metabolic complications in the developing world. The maternal, fetal, peripartum and neonatal complications of obesity in pregnancy have far-reaching implications for both mother and offspring. Of alarming interest is the increasing rate of obesity among adolescents and the cycle of obesity in future generations it portends. The purpose in this review is to briefly review the maternal perinatal morbidities associated with maternal pregravid obesity. Additionally, we will review evidence of both short- and long-term effect of maternal obesity on the in utero environment as it relates to fetal growth, neonatal body composition and adolescent obesity.},

These have been hard to come by, and so as my last act before leaving office, I decided to provide a short survey paper on some related ideas in a field where nearly all of us sometimes work-that of contingency tables. These ideas are largely available in the literature, and yet they have not often been put together, though I. J. Good's monograph [9] and Leo Goodman's many papers form good sources. But my paper is not intended as a review of the literature, only as a survey of one set of ideas about estimation in the analysis of contingency tables. I fear that the first act of most social scientists upon seeing a contingency table is to compute chi-square for it. Sometimes this process is enlightening, sometimes wasteful, but sometimes it does not go quite far enough.},

"Prolonged fetal exposure to elevated glucose levels results in chronic fetal hyperinsulinemia, which in turn triggers the fetus to increase oxygen consumption and metabolism, inducing chronic intrauterine tissue hypoxia (37). Further biological responses may result in fetal iron deficiency (38). Both fetal hypoxia and iron deficiency can profoundly affect neurodevelopment in humans, including alterations in myelination and cortical connectivity and abberations in hippocampal neurons (39). Fetal iron deficiency has also been associated wtih reduced recognition memory as well as behavioral and developmental problems (40)."

By incorporating sufficient causes on a graph, it is possible to detect conditional independencies within strata of the conditioning variable which are not evident on DAGs without the representation of sufficient causes. It is also possible to determine the sign of the conditional covariance of two causes when conditioning on their common effect if some knowledge of the sufficient-cause mechanisms for the common effect is available. The incorporation of sufficient causes within the DAG framework also allows for the representation of interactions on DAGs and for the unification of several different causal frameworks. For illustration, the results are applied to an example concerning the familial coaggregation of two disorders.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis and inflammation are pivotal processes in developing endometriosis in the peritoneal cavity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate these two processes in women with endometriosis who had been treated with danazol to determine the sensitivity of a non-invasive test in diagnosing endometriosis. The clinical follow-up study was conducted in a group of 103 women diagnosed laparoscopically with endometriosis. Thirty-five patients qualified for danazol treatment. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale, whereas endometriosis was assessed using the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) scale. Cancer antigen (CA)-125 and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in plasma and peritoneal fluid were determined by immunoenzymatic methods, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ concentrations in plasma and peritoneal fluid were determined by ELISA. Endometrial expression of IL-8 and platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide (PDGF-A) was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Women with endometriosis (68.9{\%} of patients) had higher plasma concentrations of CA-125, as well as higher concentrations of both CA-125 and VEGF in the peritoneal fluid. Endometrial expression of IL-8 mRNA was significantly higher, whereas that of PDGF-A was significantly lower, in contrast. After danazol treatment the patients reported lower pain scores; in addition, CA-125 concentrations in the plasma were decreased (P{\textless}0.001), whereas VEGF concentration in the plasma increased (P=0.009). For the diagnosis of endometriosis, none of the combinations of given markers had a sensitivity {\textgreater}60{\%}. Danazol treatment is highly effective in relieving pain and decreasing CA-125 concentrations in the plasma. Higher plasma concentrations of VEGF after treatment could imply stimulation of angiogenesis.},

Items describing common behavioral and emotional problems in this population were generated by extracting descriptions from 664 case files of children and adolescents with behavior disorders seen at a specialist developmental assessment service over 12 years. These items were reduced to a set of 96 items administered to a sample of 1,093 children and adolescents with mental retardation and then submitted to a principal components analysis. Six interpretable and partly validated subscales were obtained which explained 36{\%} of the total variance and had satisfactory internal consistency. Interrater and test-retest agreement were satisfactory for both total scale score and for scores on each of the subscales. Good evidence of concurrent validity was provided by substantial positive correlations between total scores on the DBC completed by lay informants and the ratings of experienced psychiatrists based upon interviews and scores on two standardized instruments that must be completed by health professionals. The discriminative validity of the total score as assessed by area under the ROC curve was excellent (92{\%}). Standardized norms for the DBC are derived from an epidemiological study of behavior problems in children and adolescents with mental retardation undertaken in two Australian States.

Nonetheless, few well-designed efforts have been undertaken to promote positive and reduce negative youth outcomes by enhancing sibling relationships.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Based on a theoretical model of sibling influences, we conducted a randomized trial of Siblings Are Special (SIBS), a group-format afterschool program for fifth graders with a younger sibling in second through fourth grades, which entailed 12 weekly afterschool sessions and three Family Nights. We tested program efficacy with a pre- and post-test design with 174 families randomly assigned to condition. In home visits at both time points, we collected data via parent questionnaires, child interviews, and observer-rated videotaped interactions and teachers rated children's behavior at school.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The program enhanced positive sibling relationships, appropriate strategies for parenting siblings, and child self-control, social competence, and academic performance; program exposure was also associated with reduced maternal depression and child internalizing problems. Results were robust across the sample, not qualified by sibling gender, age, family demographics, or baseline risk. No effects were found for sibling conflict, collusion, or child externalizing problems; we will examine follow-up data to determine if short-term impacts lead to reduced negative behaviors over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The breadth of the SIBS program's impact is consistent with research suggesting that siblings are an important influence on development and adjustment and supports our argument that a sibling focus should be incorporated into youth and family-oriented prevention programs.},

abstract = {To examine the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and cognitive test scores of children at early primary school age. A descriptive observational design was used. Study subjects consist of 3,412 US children aged 60-83 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Mother and Child Survey. Cognitive test scores using the Peabody Individual Achievement Test reading recognition and mathematics tests were used as the outcomes of interest. Association with maternal prepregnancy obesity was examined using the ordinary least square regression controlling for intrauterine, family background, maternal and child factors. Children of obese women had 3 points (0.23 SD units) lower peabody individual achievement test (PIAT) reading recognition score (p = 0.007), and 2 points (0.16 SD units) lower PIAT mathematics scores (p {\textless} 0.0001), holding all other factors constant. As expected, cognitive test score was associated with stimulating home environment (reading: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001), household income (reading: $\beta$ = 0.03, p = 0.02 and math: $\beta$ = 0.04, p = 0.004), maternal education (reading: $\beta$ = 0.42, p = 0.0005, and math: $\beta$ = 0.32, p = 0.008), and maternal cognitive skills (reading: $\beta$ = 0.11, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.09, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was a significant association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores that could not be explained by other intrauterine, family background, maternal, and child factors. Children who live in disadvantaged postnatal environments may be most affected by the effects of maternal prepregnancy obesity. Replications of the current study using different cohorts are warranted to confirm the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores.},

"Pregnancy and birth complications are more common with excessive gestational weight gain, and therefore, weight gain during pregnancy is a significnate health concern for both motehr and child. Excessive gestational weight gain alone is a n independent factor for a number of adverse neonatal outcomes (24), which may lead to delayed child cognitive development. However, results of the current study did not demonstrate an association between maternal gestational weight gain above the IOM recommendation and cognitive test scores in our sample."

"Studies examining the relationship between birthweight and children's cognitive test scores have produced mixed results. A few studies have found a quadrativ relation (25) and other studies have found a linear relation (9, 26), or no relation at all."

"a systematic review of the studies examining the association between birth weight and cognitive skills has shown a linear relation with inconsistent results at a higher end of birth weight (28). In the current study, we found a linear association between birth weight and reading scores, whereas math scores followed a qudratic association."},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the degree to which children born within the "normal term" range of 37 to 41 weeks' gestation vary in terms of school achievement. METHODS: This study analyzed data from 128050 singleton births born between 37 and 41 weeks' gestation in a large US city. Data were extracted from city birth records to assess a number of obstetric, social, and economic variables, at both the individual and community levels. Birth data were then matched with public school records of standardized city-wide third-grade reading and math tests. Specifically, we assessed (1) whether children born within the normal term range of 37 to 41 weeks' gestation show differences in reading and/or math ability 8 years later as a function of gestational age, and (2) the degree to which a wide range of individual- and community-level social and biological factors mediate this effect. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that gestational age within the normal term range was significantly and positively related to reading and math scores in third grade, with achievement scores for children born at 37 and 38 weeks significantly lower than those for children born at 39, 40, or 41 weeks. This effect was independent of birth weight, as well as a number of other obstetric, social, and economic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier normal term birth may be a characteristic considered by researchers, clinicians, and parents to help identify children who may be at risk for poorer school performance.},

We compared prenatal risk factors and birth outcomes of First Nations and M{\'{e}}tis women with those of other participants in a prospective study.; Methods: During the 12-month period from July 1994 to June 1995, we invited expectant mothers in all obstetric practices affiliated with a single teaching hospital in Edmonton to participate. Women were recruited at their first prenatal visit and followed through delivery. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained by means of a patient questionnaire, and microbiological data were collected at 3 points during gestation: in the first and second trimesters and during labour. Our primary outcomes of interest were low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500 g), prematurity (birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation) and macrosomia (birth weight greater than 4000 g).; Results: Of the 2047 women consecutively enrolled, 1811 completed the study through delivery. Aboriginal women accounted for 70 (3.9{\%}) of the subjects who completed the study (45 First Nations women and 25 M{\'{e}}tis women). Known risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome were more common among Aboriginal than among non-Aboriginal women, including previous premature infant (21{\%} v. 11{\%}), smoking during the current pregnancy (41{\%} v. 13{\%}), presence of bacterial vaginosis in midgestation (33{\%} v. 13{\%}) and poor nutrition as measured by meal consumption. Although Aboriginal women were less likely than non-Aboriginal women to have babies of low birth weight (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.52-4.15) or who were born prematurely (OR 1.45, 95{\%} CI 0.57-3.72) and more likely to have babies with macrosomia (OR 2.04, 95{\%} CI 1.03-4.03), these differences were lower and statistically nonsignificant after adjustment for smoking, cervicovaginal infection and income (adjusted OR for low birth weight 0.85, 95{\%} CI 0.19-3.78; for prematurity 0.90, 95{\%} CI 0.21-3.89; and for macrosomia 2.12, 95{\%} CI 0.84-5.36).; Interpretation: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, we found no statistically significant relation between Aboriginal status and birth outcome.; },

It aggregates motehr ratings of the frequency of 27 child behavior problems during a 1-year reference period for children at least 4 years of age. Bradly et al (31) reported a test-retest correlation for the total BPI of .92 and a Cronbach alpha of .89 among young children in the NLSY-MC. The BPI was validated against data from teh 1981 National Health Interview Survey.

abstract = {Women proven to be extremely high risk for drinking during pregnancy were provided case management (CM) enhanced with strategies derived from motivational interviewing (MI) as a part of a comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) epidemiology and prevention program in four American Indian communities in Northern Plains states. Data on the first women enrolled (n=131) revealed that they have extreme issues with alcohol abuse to overcome. Sixty-five percent of these women have experienced extensive alcohol use within their immediate family. At intake, 24{\%} of CM clients reported binge drinking one or more days in the preceding week. Heavy drinking resulted in estimated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) as high as .576 using the BACCUS methodology. Project staff has attempted to actively engage each of these women in CM. Clients have been in CM an average of 17.2 months (SD=16.6). The mean number of significant contacts (face-to-face or telephone MI sessions) was 19. Thirty-one percent of the women entered some type of formal alcohol or drug treatment while in CM. Data were collected at 6 month intervals from 6 to 72 months after enrollment. Consumption of alcohol, as measured by both quantity and frequency measures, was reduced at 6 months. Thirty-eight percent of enrolled women reported complete abstinence from alcohol use at 6 months, and the number of binges while drinking in CM declined significantly from 15 at baseline to 4.3 at 6 months. However, mean peak BACs for the heavy drinking sessions were still problematic for those who continued to drink. They ranged from .234 to .275 from baseline to 12 month follow-up, but the total number of binges was reduced substantially at 12 months as well. Furthermore, the most important outcomes are the status of the children born while in CM. One hundred and forty nine pregnancies have occurred among these women, and 76{\%} of those pregnancies have resulted in normal deliveries, and only two children born in CM are suspected of having some form of severe FASD. At 6, 12, 18, and 24 month follow-up milestones, 70{\%} of the women who were not currently pregnant were protected from having a child with FAS by not drinking, using birth control, or both. Other measures of CM success include enrolling in school, regaining custody of children, completing substance abuse treatment, probation from the criminal justice system, substantial periods of abstinence, enrolling in programs to improve life skills, and employment.},

We describe examples of selection bias in case-control studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring).

This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding").

"Because abstaining from alcohol prior to and throughout pregnancy is the only way to guarantee the birth of a child free of FAS/FAE, prevention programs try to target women before they become pregnant. However, the programs also should target women who are drinking during pregnancy, to increase their likelihood of having healthy babies in the current as well as subsequent pregnancies."


"As 80 percent of the pregnancies in the study population are unplanned and the women do not begin prenatal care until the second semester, the warning label reaches them before health care providers do."

found awareness of the label increased after warning label law

"women who are older and have had multiple children tend to drink more than younger women who have not had children"

"women who needed the warning the most, those drinking at risk levels, did not change the amount of alcohol they consumed after the warning label was implemented."

"One explanation is that 71{\%} of the risk drinkers had been pregnant before. Although we were blinded to the outcome of the women's births, we hypothesize that the women believe (rightly or wrongly) that their babies are healthy). Women in the study were asked how often it was safe to drink while pregnant and how likely it was that their baby would be healthy if they drank alcohol at risk levels. Responses suggest that pregnant women who previously gave birth to babies are more likely to feel safe drinking daily and to believe their future babies will be healthy if they drink heavily during pregnancy than do women who never gave birth."

increase education among medical providers successful in terms of them asking patients about alcohol consumption

boston program increase self-esteem, promote abstinence, refer to treatment and community agencies successful in reducing drinking by third trimester

awareness among pregnant women about the risks of alcohol during pregnancy successful

among Navajo/Hopi: "The project operates prevention programs that involve communitywide FAS education, prenatal clinic screening for alcohol use, and education for women in prenatal clinics. For women identified as high risk because they drink heavily during their pregnancies and previously gave birth to a child with FAS or FAE, the prevention program includes detoxification, individual and group therapy, and voluntary birth control or sterilization services."

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated an association between low birth weight (LBW; {\textless}2500 g) and adverse intelligence quotient (IQ) outcomes in childhood and early adolescence. We systematically evaluated whether this association persists into late adolescence and early adulthood and also assessed the influence of age of IQ assessment on effect size.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: During Stage 1 (meta-analysis of data on adolescents/adults), we searched for relevant articles in PsychINFO, PubMed, Ovid, CINAHL, ProQuest and ERIC until February 2011 (no lower limit). Studies which assessed full-scale IQ among LBW individuals ({\textless}2500 g), aged 13 years and older, with a normal birth weight (NBW; ≥2500 g) comparison group were eligible. A random-effects meta-analysis provided a pooled estimate of the difference in IQ scores between LBW and NBW individuals. Publication bias was assessed using Rosenthal's classic fail-safe N and Duval and Tweedie's Trim and Fill. During Stage 2, we added data from the Kerr-Wilson et al. meta-analysis (which included data from children; in Meta-analysis of the association between preterm delivery and intelligence. Journal Public Health 2011;33:1-8) to our sample from Stage 1 and conducted a meta-regression to evaluate the effect of age of IQ assessment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using a total of 15 studies in Stage 1, it was demonstrated that NBW individuals scored an average of 7.63 IQ points higher than LBW individuals, CI = 5.95-9.31. After adjusting for publication bias, NBW samples demonstrated an IQ of 4.98 points higher than LBW samples, CI = 3.20-6.77. Furthermore, age at IQ assessment was a significant moderator of the association between birth weight and IQ, in that the effect size decreased from childhood into young adulthood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairments associated with LBW persist into adolescence and early adulthood; however, the influence of LBW on IQ decreases from childhood to young adulthood. These conclusions must be interpreted with caution due to unmeasured variables and possible influence from publication bias.},

abstract = {Infants born to HIV-infected women are at increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment, but little research has attempted to identify modifiable risk factors. The objective of this prospective cohort analysis was to identify maternal, socioeconomic, and child correlates of psychomotor and mental development in the first 18 mo of life among Tanzanian infants born to HIV-infected women. We hypothesized that child HIV infection, morbidity, and undernutrition would be associated with lower developmental status when taking into consideration maternal health and socioeconomic factors. Baseline maternal characteristics were recorded during pregnancy, birth characteristics were collected immediately after delivery, infant micronutrient status was measured at 6 wk and 6 mo, and anthropometric measurements and morbidity histories were performed at monthly follow-up visits. The Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (BSID-II) were used to assess developmental functioning at 6, 12, and 18 mo of age. Multivariate repeated regression models with time-varying covariates were used to estimate adjusted mean MDI and PDI scores for each level of the variables. A total of 311 infants contributed ≥1 BSID-II assessments for 657 PDI and 655 MDI measurements. Of infants, 51{\%} were male, 23{\%} were born preterm, 7{\%} were low birth weight, and 10{\%} were HIV-positive at 6 wk. Preterm birth, child HIV infection, stunting, and wasting were independently associated with lower PDI and MDI scores. Strategies to lower mother-to-child transmission of HIV, prevent preterm birth, and enhance child growth could contribute to improved child psychomotor and mental development.},

We identified predictors of nonadherence to scheduled antiretroviral drug pickup appointments in a large HIV care and treatment program in Tanzania. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 44, 204 HIV-infected adults on ART between November 2004 and September 2012. Multivariate generalized estimating equation for repeated binary data was used to estimate the relative risk and 95{\%} confidence intervals of nonadherence. RESULTS: Nonadherence was significantly greater among patients with high CD4 counts, high body mass indices, males, younger patients, patients with longer durations on ART, and those with perceived low social support. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted interventions should be developed to improve ART adherence among healthier, younger, and more experienced patients who are on ART for longer durations within HIV care and treatment programs. Social support for patients on ART should be emphasized.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Both underweight and obese mothers have an increased risk for adverse  offspring outcomes. Few studies have examined the association between prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and children's neurodevelopment. SUBJECTS: We  used data from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B; n=6850). Children were classified according to their  mother's prepregnancy BMI (kg m(-2)) status: underweight (BMI {\textless}18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obese class I (BMI 30.0-34.9), and obese class II and III (BMI {\textgreater}/=35.0). Children's age-adjusted mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) T-scores (mean 50, s.d. 10) were obtained using a validated shortened version of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II at approximately 2 years of age. While adjusting for sociodemographics, we estimated the average MDI and PDI scores or the risk of delayed ({\textless}-1 s.d. vs {\textgreater}1 s.d.) mental or motor development, relative to children of normal weight mothers. RESULTS: Compared with children of normal weight mothers, MDI scores were lower among children of mothers of all other prepregnancy BMI categories, with the greatest adjusted difference among children of class II and III obese mothers (-2.13 (95{\%} CI -3.32, -0.93)). The adjusted risk of delayed mental development was increased among children of underweight (risk ratio (RR) 1.36 (95{\%} CI 1.04, 1.78)) and class II and III obese (RR 1.38 (95{\%} CI 1.03, 1.84)) mothers. Children's PDI scores or motor delay did not differ by maternal prepregnancy BMI. CONCLUSION: In this nationally representative sample of 2-year-old US children, low and very-high maternal prepregnancy BMI were associated with increased risk of delayed mental development but not motor development.},

"The obserced association between mother's prepregnancy BMI and children's mental development may be attributable to several mechanisms. Potential biological mechanisms may include inadequate prenatal micronutrient status (32-35), elevated stress levels (36-38), adn an inflammatory intrauterine environment (6, 9, 10). Specifically, obesity related intrauterine inflammation may have a direct effect on the cognitive funciton of offspring by damaging the developing fetal brain, or by making the developing fetus more susceptible to other introuterine environmental insults by increasing the permeability of the fetal blood-brain barrier (12)."},

abstract = {The effects of adrenal corticosteroids on subsequent adrenocorticotropin secretion are complex. Acutely (within hours), glucocorticoids (GCs) directly inhibit further activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, but the chronic actions (across days) of these steroids on brain are directly excitatory. Chronically high concentrations of GCs act in three ways that are functionally congruent. (i) GCs increase the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala, a critical node in the emotional brain. CRF enables recruitment of a chronic stress-response network. (ii) GCs increase the salience of pleasurable or compulsive activities (ingesting sucrose, fat, and drugs, or wheel-running). This motivates ingestion of "comfort food." (iii) GCs act systemically to increase abdominal fat depots. This allows an increased signal of abdominal energy stores to inhibit catecholamines in the brainstem and CRF expression in hypothalamic neurons regulating adrenocorticotropin. Chronic stress, together with high GC concentrations, usually decreases body weight gain in rats; by contrast, in stressed or depressed humans chronic stress induces either increased comfort food intake and body weight gain or decreased intake and body weight loss. Comfort food ingestion that produces abdominal obesity, decreases CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus of rats. Depressed people who overeat have decreased cerebrospinal CRF, catecholamine concentrations, and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity. We propose that people eat comfort food in an attempt to reduce the activity in the chronic stress-response network with its attendant anxiety. These mechanisms, determined in rats, may explain some of the epidemic of obesity occurring in our society.},

abstract = {The AhR was initially identified as a ligand-activated transcription factor mediating effects of chlorinated dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) expression. Recently, evidence supporting involvement of the AhR in cell-cycle regulation and tumorigenesis has been presented. To further define the roles of the AhR in cancer, we investigated the effects of AhR expression on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. In these studies, the properties of MCF-7 cells were compared with those of two MCF-7-derived sublines: AH(R100) , which express minimal AhR, and AhR(exp) , which overexpress AhR. Quantitative PCR, Western immunoblots, 17$\beta$-estradiol (E2 ) metabolism assays, and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase assays showed the lack of AhR expression and AhR-regulated CYP1 expression in AH(R100) cells, and enhanced AhR and CYP1 expression in AhR(exp) cells. In the presence of 1 nM E2 , rates of cell proliferation of the three cell lines showed an inverse correlation with the levels of AhR mRNA. In comparison with MCF-7 and AhR(exp) cells, AH(R100) cells produced more colonies in soft agar and showed enhanced migration and invasion in chamber assays with E2 as the chemoattractant. Despite the lack of significant AhR expression, AH(R100) cells retained the ability to form tumors in severe combined immunodeficient mice when supplemented with E2 , producing mean tumor volumes comparable to those observed with MCF-7 cells. These studies indicate that, while CYP1 expression and inducibility are highly dependent on AhR expression, the proliferation, invasion, migration, anchorage-independent growth, and estrogen-stimulated tumor formation of MCF-7 cells do not require the AhR. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study potential effects of maternal body composition on central nervous system (CNS) development of newborn infants. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to evaluate brain white matter development in 2-week-old, full-term, appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants from uncomplicated pregnancies of normal-weight (BMI {\textless} 25 at conception) or obese ( BMI = 30 at conception) and otherwise healthy mothers. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were used for voxel-wise group comparison of fractional anisotropy (FA), a sensitive measure of white matter integrity. DNA methylation analyses of umbilical cord tissue focused on genes known to be important in CNS development were also performed. RESULTS: Newborns from obese women had significantly lower FA values in multiple white matter regions than those born of normal-weight mothers. Global and regional FA values negatively correlated (P {\textless} 0.05) with maternal fat mass percentage. Linear regression analysis followed by gene ontology enrichment showed that methylation status of 68 CpG sites representing 57 genes with GO terms related to CNS development was significantly associated with maternal adiposity status. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a negative association between maternal adiposity and white matter development in offspring.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diesel exhaust has been considered to be a probable lung carcinogen based on studies of occupationally exposed workers. Efforts to define lung cancer risk in these studies have been limited in part by lack of quantitative exposure estimates. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess lung cancer mortality risk among U.S. trucking industry workers. Elemental carbon (EC) was used as a surrogate of exposure to engine exhaust from diesel vehicles, traffic, and loading dock operations. METHODS: Work records were available for 31,135 male workers employed in the unionized U.S. trucking industry in 1985. A statistical model based on a national exposure assessment was used to estimate historical work-related exposures to EC. Lung cancer mortality was ascertained through the year 2000, and associations with cumulative and average EC were estimated using proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Duration of employment was inversely associated with lung cancer risk consistent with a healthy worker survivor effect and a cohort composed of prevalent hires. After adjusting for employment duration, we noted a suggestion of a linear exposure response relationship. For each I,000-mu g/m(3) months of cumulative EC, based on a 5-year exposure lag, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.07 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.99, 1.15] with a similar association for a 10-year exposure lag [HR = 1.09 (95{\%} CI: 0.99, 1.20)]. Average exposure was not associated with relative risk. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer mortality in trucking industry workers increased in association with cumulative exposure to EC after adjusting for negative confounding by employment duration.},

abstract = {The potent developmental toxicity of dioxin in multiple species has been known for a number of years. However, recent studies have indicated that dioxin also induces functional developmental defects, many of which are delayed. Subtle structural deficits, not detectable at birth, have also been described in multiple species and in both sexes. Certain defects have been reported not only in animals but also in children prenatally exposed to complex mixtures containing dioxinlike compounds. None of the effects can be attributed to modulation of any one endocrine system. For example, dioxin does not bind to the estrogen receptor, but it can cause effects that are both estrogenic and antiestrogenic. However, viewing dioxin and related compounds as endocrine disruptors that may alter multiple pathways sheds some light on the complexities of this potent class of growth dysregulators.},

abstract = {Bias due to selective mortality is a potential concern in many studies and is especially relevant in cognitive aging research because cognitive impairment strongly predicts subsequent mortality. Biased estimation of the effect of an exposure on rate of cognitive decline can occur when mortality is a common effect of exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline and in similar settings. This potential is often represented as collider-stratification bias in directed acyclic graphs, but it is difficult to anticipate the magnitude of bias. In this paper, we present a flexible simulation platform with which to quantify the expected bias in longitudinal studies of determinants of cognitive decline. We evaluated potential survival bias in naive analyses under several selective survival scenarios, assuming that exposure had no effect on cognitive decline for anyone in the population. Compared with the situation with no collider bias, the magnitude of bias was higher when exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline interacted on the hazard ratio scale to influence mortality or when both exposure and rate of cognitive decline influenced mortality. Bias was, as expected, larger in high-mortality situations. This simulation platform provides a flexible tool for evaluating biases in studies with high mortality, as is common in cognitive aging research.},

There is concern that alcohol abstinence recommendations lead women using low levels of alcohol to terminate otherwise wanted pregnancies. This study examines how women describe alcohol, tobacco and/or drug use (ATOD) as reasons for deciding to have abortions and assesses the differences between women reporting and not reporting ATOD as reasons for deciding to have an abortion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data come from the UCSF Turnaway Study which recruited 956 women seeking an abortion at one of 30 US clinics between 2008 and 2010. Mixed methods were used and data were analyzed through thematic coding and logistic regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nearly 5{\%} reported ATOD as a reason for abortion. Women worried that their ATOD had affected their baby's health and that their or their partner's ATOD would influence parenting. Most women (84{\%}) who reported alcohol as a reason binge drank or had an alcohol-problem symptom in the month before discovering their pregnancy. Sixty-one percent who reported drugs as a reason used drugs, with 88{\%} using more than once/week. Although two-thirds smoked tobacco, no woman reported tobacco alone as a reason. Ninety-eight percent of women reporting ATOD as a reason had unintended pregnancies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Women reporting ATOD as a reason drink at levels exceeding a low threshold and do not appear to be terminating otherwise wanted pregnancies. Thus, findings are inconsistent with hypotheses that abstinence recommendations and punitive policies lead women using low levels of alcohol or using drugs to terminate otherwise wanted pregnancies.},

Methods HIV-1-infected adults (≥15 years) initiated on first-line ART between November 2004 and September 2012, and who remained on initial therapy for at least 24 weeks before switching, were studied. Survival analyses were conducted to examine the effect of second-line ART on mortality and loss to follow-up in: (i) the whole cohort; (ii) all patients eligible for second-line ART by immunological failure (IF) and/or virological failure (VF) criteria; and (iii) patients eligible by VF criteria. Results In total, 47 296 HIV-infected patients [mean age 37.5 (SD 9.5) years, CD4 175 (SD 158) cells/mm 3 , 71{\%} female] were included in the analyses. Of these, 1760 (3.7{\%}) patients switched to second-line ART (incidence rate = 1.7/100 person-years). Higher rates of mortality were observed in switchers versus non-switchers in all patients and patients with ART failure using IF/VF criteria. Switching only protected against mortality in patients with ART failure defined virologically and with the highest level of adherence [switching versus non-switching; {\textgreater}95{\%} adherence; adjusted HR = 0.50 (95{\%} CI = 0.26-0.93); P = 0.03]. Conclusions Switching patients to second-line ART may only be beneficial in a select group of patients who are virologically monitored and demonstrate good adherence. Our data emphasize the need for routine viral load monitoring and aggressive adherence interventions in HIV programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract = {A three-part hypothesis is proposed to explain the unusual epidemiology of gastroschisis, a congenital abnormality of the abdominal wall, which has a rising frequency, a higher rate in first and young mothers in whites but not blacks, and a unique negative correlation with obesity. The hypothesis involves: (1) An early estrogenic thrombophilia, (2) racial differences in thrombosis, and (3) thrombotic by-products interfering with early developmental signaling. For the first: (1) An estrogenic thrombophilia is a known effect. (2) A mouse model links excess estrogen to thromboses affecting the fetus. (3) Young and first mothers have higher first trimester estrogen levels. (4) A negative correlation between body mass index and pregnancy estradiol accounts for the weight relationship. (5) Maternal alcohol raises estrogen levels in premenopausal women. (6) A link with atrazine, an estrogenic endocrine disruptor, has been found, and rising frequencies of gastroschisis make this and other such chemicals a particular concern if estrogen is indeed involved. For the second: Blacks have a different thrombophilic gene background and less of a thrombotic response to estrogen than whites, explaining racial differences. For the third: Protein palmitoylation affects cell signaling in development, and lipid rafts, a major aspect of thromboses, facilitate this process. Such thrombotic byproducts could be the source of palmitic acid rich amniotic vacuoles with gastroschisis. Similar vacuoles can occur with limb-body wall defects, another early developmental anomaly associated with decreased maternal age that may have a similar pathogenesis. Later thrombotic related anomalies with a similar epidemiology seem to primarily involve vascular disruptions, but localized signaling anomalies may also occur. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

For this case-control analysis of antecedent predictors of premature mortality, all adult deaths (n = 61) were paired with two randomly selected controls matched for sex and year of birth. RESULTS: Mean age at death was 25 (SD: 8) years. Adult death was associated with a profound bias in month of birth with 49 cases born in the nutritionally-debilitating hungry season (Jul-Dec) versus 12 in the harvest season (Jan-Jun). Relative to harvest season the hazard ratio for early death in hungry-season births rose from 3.7 (for deaths {\textgreater}14.5 years, P = 0.000013) to 10.3 (for deaths {\textgreater}25 years, P = 0.00002). Anthropometric and haematological status at 18 months of age was identical in cases and controls, indicating an earlier origin to the defect. Most deaths for which cause was known had a definite or possible infectious aetiology; none were from degenerative diseases of affluence. CONCLUSIONS: Early life exposures, correlated with season of birth, strongly influence susceptibility to fatal infections in young adulthood. The evidence suggests that nutritionally-mediated intrauterine growth retardation may permanently impair the development of immune function.},

Emotion regulation was assessed using the experience sampling method, in which adolescents provided multiple reports about the intensity, lability, and strategies used to regulate negative emotions across 1 week. Adolescents also completed self-report measures of adjustment. Adolescents who reported more intense and labile emotions and less effective regulation of these emotions also reported more depressive symptoms and problem behavior. Responding to negative emotions with disengagement (e.g., denial) or involuntary engagement (e.g., rumination) was less effective in regulating negative affect, and greater use of these strategies was related to higher levels of depressive symptoms and problem behavior.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference is usually presented as a method for determining how scientific belief should be modified by data. Although Bayesian methodology has been one of the most active areas of statistical development in the past 20 years, medical researchers have been reluctant to embrace what they perceive as a subjective approach to data analysis. It is little understood that Bayesian methods have a data-based core, which can be used as a calculus of evidence. This core is the Bayes factor, which in its simplest form is also called a likelihood ratio. The minimum Bayes factor is objective and can be used in lieu of the P value as a measure of the evidential strength. Unlike P values, Bayes factors have a sound theoretical foundation and an interpretation that allows their use in both inference and decision making. Bayes factors show that P values greatly overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis. Most important, Bayes factors require the addition of background knowledge to be transformed into inferences--probabilities that a given conclusion is right or wrong. They make the distinction clear between experimental evidence and inferential conclusions while providing a framework in which to combine prior with current evidence.},

abstract = {Case-control studies of birth defects might be subject to selection bias when there is incomplete ascertainment of cases among pregnancies that are terminated after a prenatal diagnosis of the defect. We propose a simple method to estimate inverse probability of selection weights (IPSWs) for cases ascertained from both pregnancies that end in termination and those that do not end in termination using data directly available from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and other published information. The IPSWs can then be used to adjust for selection bias analytically. We can also allow for uncertainty in the selection probabilities through probabilistic bias analysis. We provide an illustrative example using data from National Birth Defects Prevention Study (1997-2009) to examine the association between prepregnancy obesity (body mass index, measured as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, of {\textgreater}/=30 vs. {\textless}30) and spina bifida. The unadjusted odds ratio for the association between prepregnancy obesity and spina bifida was 1.48 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.26, 1.73), and the simple selection bias-adjusted odds ratio was 1.26 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.04, 1.53). The probabilistic bias analysis resulted in a median adjusted odds ratio of 1.22 (95{\%} simulation interval: 0.97, 1.47). The proposed method provides a quantitative estimate of the IPSWs and the bias introduced by incomplete ascertainment of cases among terminated pregnancies conditional on a set of assumptions.},

Infants with any chromosomal diagnosis were excluded. Effect estimates were calculated using 5-year maternal age categories with 25-29 years as the referent. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for maternal race, parity, infant sex, and birth year.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 1,050,616 singleton infants, born after {\textgreater} or = 20 weeks gestation in the five counties of metropolitan Atlanta from 1968 through 2000 who did not have a chromosomal abnormality and whose mother was 14 to 40 years old, were included in the analyses, 32,816 of them were identified with birth defects by the MACDP. Young maternal age (14-19 years) was associated with anencephaly (OR = 1.81, 95{\%} CI = 1.30-2.52), hydrocephaly without neural tube defect (OR = 1.56, 95{\%} CI = 1.23-1.96), all ear defects (OR = 1.28, 95{\%} CI = 1.10-1.49), cleft lip (OR = 1.88, 95{\%} CI = 1.30-2.73), female genital defects (OR = 1.57, 95{\%} CI = 1.12-2.19), hydronephrosis (OR = 1.42, 95{\%} CI = 1.11-1.82), polydactyly (OR = 1.29, 95{\%} CI = 1.09-1.52), omphalocele (OR = 2.08, 95{\%} CI = 1.39-3.12), and gastroschisis (OR = 7.18, 95{\%} CI = 4.39-11.75).

abstract = {Background: Screening for alcohol and drug use in prenatal care is widely promoted in the United States as a public health strategy for reducing alcohol and drug use during pregnancy. However, the published literature does not consider women's perspectives or the potential negative ramifications of screening. Methods: Twenty semistructured interviews and two focus groups (n = 38) were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of low-income pregnant and parenting women using alcohol and/or drugs in a northern California county. Results: Most women were averse to having drug but not alcohol use identified and were mistrustful of providers' often inconspicuous efforts to discover drug use. Women expected psychological, social, and legal consequences from being identified, including feelings of maternal failure, judgment by providers, and reports to Child Protective Services. Women did not trust providers to protect them from these consequences. Rather, they took steps to protect themselves. They avoided and emotionally disengaged from prenatal care, attempted to stop using substances that could be detected by urine tests before prenatal care visits, and shared strategies within social networks for gaining the benefits of prenatal care while avoiding its negative consequences. Conclusion: Considerations of the public health impact of screening for drug use in prenatal care should account for the implications of women's physical avoidance of and emotional disengagement from prenatal care, specifically the direct effects of late, limited, and no prenatal care on pregnancy outcomes and missed opportunities for health promoting interventions. ?? 2010 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.},

However, the data have been inconsistent, especially in younger women.METHODS:We evaluated the impact of age at menarche, pregnancy history, duration of breastfeeding, body mass index, combined oral contraceptive use, and alcohol consumption on breast cancer risk by ER/PR status in 1,725 population-based case patients and 440 control subjects aged 20 to 49 years identified within neighborhoods of case patients. We used multivariable unconditional logistic regression methods to conduct case-control comparisons overall as well as by ER/PR status of the cases, and to compare ER+PR+ with ER-PR- case patients.RESULTS:The number of full-term pregnancies was inversely associated with the risk of ER+PR+ breast cancer (ptrend = 0.005), whereas recent average alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of ER+PR+ breast cancer (ptrend = 0.03). Neither of these two factors was associated with the risk of ER- PR- breast cancer. Late age at menarche and a longer duration of breastfeeding were both associated with decreased breast cancer risk, irrespective of receptor status (all ptrend[less than or equal to] 0.03).CONCLUSION:Our results suggest that the number of full-term pregnancies and recent alcohol consumption affect breast cancer risk in younger women predominantly through estrogen and progesterone mediated by their respective receptors. Late age at menarche and breastfeeding may act through different hormonal mechanisms.},

abstract = {The Cree of James Bay have the highest ever reported mean birth weight and a high prevalence of infant macrosomia. This study was designed to examine independent risk factors for infant macrosomia among the Cree, to compare these to risk factors among non-Native Canadians and to determine if ethnic differences persist after adjusting for differences in the distribution of other risk factors. Macrosomia was defined as birth weight {\textgreater}90(th) percentile for gestational age of a reference population. Independent determinants of macrosomia were examined in 385 Cree and 5644 non-Native women. The potential effect of ethnicity (Cree vs. non-Native) was determined after statistically adjusting for age, parity, pregravid weight, height, net rate of weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and smoking status. The prevalence of macrosomia among the Cree was 34.3{\%} vs. 11.1{\%} among non-Natives. Although GDM significantly increased the risk for macrosomia among the Cree (odds ratio: 4.46, 95{\%} CI: 2.24-9.26), it was not a significant risk factor among non-Natives (odds ratio: 1.15, 95{\%} CI: 0.79-1.65). The risk for infant macrosomia remained elevated among the Cree compared with non-Natives after adjusting for other risk factors (odds ratio: 3.64, 95{\%} CI: 2.69-4.90). In conclusion, the Cree have a high prevalence of macrosomia despite controlling for important differences in pregravid weight and GDM. Some of this variation may be due to genetic differences in fetal growth. The differential impact of GDM on macrosomia in the two ethnic groups may be due to differences in treatment strategies for GDM.},

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 44 women with endometriosis and 58 without endometriosis, during the first three days (1st sample) and during the 7th, 8th and 9th day (2nd sample) of the menstrual cycle. Measurements of CA-125 and soluble CD-23 were performed by ELISA. Mann-Whitney U test was used for age, pain evaluations (visual analog scale) and biomarkers concentrations. RESULTS: Serum levels of CA125 were higher in endometriosis patients when compared to the control group during both periods of the menstrual cycle evaluated in the study. This marker was also elevated in women with chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia (2nd sample), dysmenorrhea (both samples) and painful defecation during the menstrual flow (2nd sample). CA-125 concentration was higher in advanced stages of the disease in both samples and also in women with ovarian endometrioma. Concerning CD-23, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups. CONCLUSION: The concentrations of CA-125 were higher in patients with endometriosis than in patients without the disease. No significantly differences were observed for soluble CD-23 levels between groups.(AU){\^{}}ien},

abstract = {There is a significant association between birth weight and cognitive test scores in childhood, even among individuals born at term and with normal birth weight. The association is not explained by the child's social background. Here we examine whether mother's cognitive ability accounts for the birth weight-cognitive ability association. We analysed mother and child data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Random effects models were employed to utilise fully the repeated cognitive tests on the same child, and to include all children of each mother. Mother's score on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) was significantly related to child's birth weight. Birth weight was significantly related to the child's scores on the Peabody Individual Achievement Test. This association was attenuated by up to two-thirds after taking into account mother's AFQT score. In this large sample the association between birth weight and cognitive ability was substantially explained by mother's IQ. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The majority (76{\%}) of adolescents reported witnessing or being victimized by at least 1 violent event in the prior 6 months. Nearly half of adolescents who had talked about their experience of a violent event reported feeling constrained from sharing their thoughts or feelings because of others' reactions. After controlling for daily hassles, more exposure to violence was associated with more self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms. Exposure to violence was not a significant predictor of teachers' ratings of adaptive functioning or internalizing symptoms. Support from specific individuals, perceived school safety, and lower constraints for discussing violence showed protective effects in the relation between exposure to violence and specific dimensions of psychological functioning. The implications of this research for school-based interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {The main goal of this work is to demonstrate the suitability of survival analysis for ontogenetic studies. The research material includes retrospective data of the age of the occurrence of ontogenetic events such as birth (N = 487), menarche (N = 2016) and menopause (N = 3597). In order to study the time of occurrence of ontogenetic events and to indicate the impact of environmental factors the survival analysis was applied. First, the percentiles of functions established for studied events were calculated. Next, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were derived. In the last step the influence of environmental factors was established and the comparison of groups determined based on the chosen factors was performed. The delivery time shows that 14{\%} of infants were born preterm. The risk of preterm delivery increases with the severity of factors disrupting pregnancy (from none to coexisting maternal and fetal risk factors) ( ; p {\textless} 0.001). In the case of menarche percentile positions indicate that the menarche occurs between the 12th and the 14th year of life as the period in which most girls exceed the puberty threshold. The Cox's proportional hazard model indicates that the time of menarche occurrence is significantly depended ( 41.602; p {\textless} 0.001) on the place of the mother's residence and number of children in the family (respectively p {\textless} 0.03 and p {\textless} 0.001). The time interval established for 50{\%} occurrence of this experience was designated between the 49th and the 52nd years of life. The time of menopause occurrence is significantly depended on both of considered factors: the educational level and smoking cigarettes ( , p {\textless} 0.001). Survival analysis is suitable for studies of the distribution in time of developmental events. It can be used to indicate the factors which significantly influence the course of development by modifying the duration of developmental stages.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of a 61-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire used in a large prospective study among women. This form was administered twice to 173 participants at an interval of approximately one year (1980-1981), and four one-week diet records for each subject were collected during that period. Intraclass correlation coefficients for nutrient intakes estimated by the one-week diet records (range = 0.41 for total vitamin A without supplements to 0.79 for vitamin B6 with supplements) were similar to those computed from the questionnaire (range = 0.49 for total vitamin A without supplements to 0.71 for sucrose), indicating that these methods were generally comparable with respect to reproducibility. With the exception of sucrose and total carbohydrate, nutrient intakes from the diet records tended to correlate more strongly with those computed from the questionnaire after adjustment for total caloric intake. Correlation coefficients between the mean calorie-adjusted intakes from the four one-week diet records and those from the questionnaire completed after the diet records ranged from 0.36 for vitamin A without supplements to 0.75 for vitamin C with supplements. Overall, 48{\%} of subjects in the lowest quintile of calorie-adjusted intake computed from the diet records were also in the lowest questionnaire quintile, and 74{\%} were in the lowest one of two questionnaire quintiles. Similarly, 49{\%} of those in the highest diet record quintile were also in the highest questionnaire quintile, and 77{\%} were in the highest one or two questionnaire quintiles. These data indicate that a simple self-administered dietary questionnaire can provide useful information about individual nutrient intakes over a one-year period.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Covariate selection to reduce bias in observational data analysis has primarily relied upon statistical criteria to guide researchers. This approach may lead researchers to condition on variables that ultimately increase bias in the effect estimates. The use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) aids researchers in constructing thoughtful models based on hypothesised biologic mechanisms to produce the least biased effect estimates possible. METHODS After providing an overview of different relations in DAGs and the prevailing mechanisms by which conditioning on variables increases or reduces bias in a model, we illustrate examples of DAGs for maternal antidepressants in pregnancy and four separate perinatal outcomes. RESULTS By comparing and contrasting the diagrams for maternal antidepressant use in pregnancy and spontaneous abortion, major malformations, preterm birth, and postnatal growth, we illustrate the different conditioning sets required for each model. Moreover, we illustrate why it is not appropriate to condition on the same set of covariates for the same exposure and different perinatal outcomes. We further discuss potential selection biases, overadjustment of mediators on the causal path, and sufficient sets of conditioning variables. CONCLUSION In our efforts to construct parsimonious models that minimise confounding and selection biases, we must rely upon our scientific knowledge of the causal mechanism. By structuring data collection and analysis around hypothesised DAGs, we ultimately aim to validly estimate the causal effect of interest.},

"The consequences of any experience that children from a particular ethnic group have in their own home environments depends on the history of intergroup relations in that group's current societal context and the gress of connectedness between family life and other societal institutions designed to support child well-being."
"Thus, there is reason to suspect that certain aspects of the home environment may be less strongly associated with child behavior and development in older children"
"estimates of the heritability of many characteristics increase with age, suggestive of more active selection of environments deemed desirable by children as they grow older."
"Relatedly, Scarr (1992) and others (eg Rowe, Jacobson, Van den Oord 1999) have arged that environmental influences are greatest in conditions that pose a risk or hazard for development."
"Rowe and colleagues (1999) recently found that environmental conditions shared by members of the same family had greater influence in families in which mothers had low educational attainment as compared with families in which mothers had high educational attainment."

"The HLM analyses revealed a complicated set of relations between HOME-SF scores and children's behavior problems"
"Overall, fewer behavior problems were observed among children from families with more positive HOME-SF Scale scores, especially when children were older. The patter of association varied as a function of both ethnicity and poverty status, however."
"Pairwise comparisons indicated that associations between learning stimulation and the BPI were stronger among European American children... than among African American children"
"The fact that learning stimulation in this study was associated with children's behavior problems in every ethnic group from early childhood through adolescence, despite controlling for family demographics, parental responsiveness, and the level of spanking, suggests that theories about the causes and maintenance of behavior problems may need to be expanded to consider the roles played by the object environment and direct efforts of parents to provide learning opportunities for their children."
"Other researchers have also observed that the relation between harsh parenting and behavior problems increases with age (Pettit et al., 1997)"},

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 women who had given birth within the preceding 12 months. Many women spoke of the negative health consequences of excessive weight gain, yet they found it difficult to lose weight due to individual constraints such as lack of time, cultural beliefs about diet while breastfeeding, and community constraints including lack of child care and lack of community programs for mothers.},

Interaction and effect modification are formally defined within the counterfactual framework. Interaction is defined in terms of the effects of 2 interventions whereas effect modification is defined in terms of the effect of one intervention varying across strata of a second variable. Effect modification can be present with no interaction; interaction can be present with no effect modification. There are settings in which it is possible to assess effect modification but not interaction, or to assess interaction but not effect modification. The analytic procedures for obtaining estimates of effect modification parameters and interaction parameters using marginal structural models are compared and contrasted. A characterization is given of the settings in which interaction and effect modification coincide.},

Although the mechanisms behind these relationships are unclear, an involvement of epigenetic dysregulation has been hypothesized. Here we show that individuals who were prenatally exposed to famine during the Dutch Hunger Winter in 1944-45 had, 6 decades later, less DNA methylation of the imprinted IGF2 gene compared with their unexposed, same-sex siblings. The association was specific for periconceptional exposure, reinforcing that very early mammalian development is a crucial period for establishing and maintaining epigenetic marks. These data are the first to contribute empirical support for the hypothesis that early-life environmental conditions can cause epigenetic changes in humans that persist throughout life.},

We assessed the risk of ASD in offspring in relation to ART by conducting a meta-analysis. A literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases through April 30, 2016 was conducted to identify all the relevant records. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%}CIs) were computed to analyze the strength of association by using fixed- or random-effect models based on heterogeneity test in total and subgroup analyses. Analysis of the total 11 records (3 cohort studies and 8 case-control studies) revealed that the use of ART is associated with higher percentage of ASD (RR = 1.35, 95{\%} CI: 1.09-1.68, P = 0.007). In addition, subgroup analyses based on study design, study location and study quality were conducted, and some subgroups also showed a statistically significant association. Our study indicated that the use of ART may associated with higher risk of ASD in the offspring. However, further prospective, large, and high-quality studies are still required.},

Gilbert (Am J Epidemiol 1991; 134:440-1) proposed that these examples occurred because the errors in exposure were systematic, and she pointed out that the relation between the measured and the true exposure was not monotonic. Assuming that the mean response either monotonically increases or decreases with the true exposure and that the exposure misclassification is nondifferential, the authors show that if the mean value of the measured exposure increases with the true exposure, then the direction of the trend cannot be reversed. Consequently, Gilbert's intimation that reversal of trend can only occur when errors are systematic is correct. However, the present authors' result is stronger in that even when errors in assessing exposure do include a systematic component, if monotonicity can be assumed, reversal of trend cannot occur. The weaker condition of positive correlation between the measured and true exposure is not sufficient to guarantee nonreversal of trend, as they show by example.},

However, little work has been done to quantify the bias caused by this type of unmeasured confounding and determine whether this bias will materially affect conclusions regarding mediation. The author developed a sensitivity analysis program to address this crucial issue. Data from 2 well-known studies in the methodological literature on mediation were reanalyzed using this program. The results of mediation analyses were found not to be as vulnerable to the impact of confounding as previously described; however, these findings varied sharply between the 2 studies. Although the indirect effect observed in one study could potentially be due to a cause common to both the mediator and the outcome, such confounding could not feasibly explain the results of the other study. These disparate results demonstrate the utility of the current sensitivity analysis when assessing mediation.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal diabetes in pregnancy and offspring cognitive ability and also to assess whether the association was due to intrauterine mechanisms or shared familial characteristics. METHODS: We linked national registers and conducted a prospective cohort study of singleton Swedish-born men to explore associations between maternal pregnancy diabetes and educational achievement at age 16 years, the age of completing compulsory education in Sweden (n = 391,545 men from 337,174 families, graduating in 1988-1997 and n = 326,033 men from 282,079 families, graduating in 1998-2009), and intelligence quotient (IQ) at the mandatory conscription examination at 18 years of age (n = 664,871 from 543,203 families). RESULTS: Among non-siblings, maternal diabetes in pregnancy was associated with lower offspring cognitive ability even after adjustment for maternal age at birth, parity, education, early-pregnancy BMI, offspring birth year, gestational age and birthweight. For example, in non-siblings, the IQ of men whose mothers had diabetes in their pregnancy was on average 1.36 points lower (95{\%} CI -2.12, -0.60) than men whose mothers did not have diabetes. In comparison, we found no such association within sibships (mean difference 1.70; 95{\%} CI -1.80, 5.21). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The association between maternal diabetes in pregnancy and offspring cognitive outcomes is likely explained by shared familial characteristics and not by an intrauterine mechanism.},

abstract = {Prenatal exposure to inflammatory stimuli is known to influence adult brain function. In addition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired by a local pro-inflammatory microenvironment. On this basis, we hypothesized that a pro-inflammatory insult during gestation would have negative effects on adult neurogenesis in the offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats received subcutaneous injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.5mg/kg) or saline every other day from gestational day 14 to 20. The adult offspring prenatally treated with LPS showed a decrease in the proliferating cells and the newborn neurons of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, prenatal LPS treatment impaired performance in the neurogenesis-dependent novel object recognition test. Maternal care was impaired by prenatal LPS administration but did not contribute to the effects of prenatal LPS on adult neurogenesis. Persistent microglial activation and downregulated expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF$\beta$(1)) occurred specifically in the adult hippocampus of animals treated prenatally with LPS. Importantly, chronic hippocampal TGF$\beta$(1) overexpression restored neurogenesis as well as recognition memory performance to control levels. These findings demonstrate that prenatal inflammation triggered by LPS impairs adult neurogenesis and recognition memory. Furthermore, we provide a model of reduced adult neurogenesis with long-lasting defined alterations in the neurogenic niche. Finally, we show that the expression of a single cytokine (TGF$\beta$(1)) in the hippocampus can restore adult neurogenesis and its related behavior, highlighting the role of TGF$\beta$(1) in these processes.},

offspring of obese mice were more active -- traveled greater distances, faster locomotor speed

"Children of obese mothers have been reported to have more emotional difficulties than the children of normal weight mothers (2).

No differences in anxiety-like behavior... suggesting that hyperactivity of the OO mice was nt driven by anxiety-related activity."

enhanced cardiovascular responses "indicate increased sympathetic activity, and may be either driving the behavioral hyperactivity or be on the causal pathway."

"There are several potential ways in which the dietary environment could influence developmental programming, including the induction of epigenetic modification of DNA that can result in altered gene expression"

"Altered leptin levels could be another potential mediator for the behavioral effects observed as leptin levels have been shown previously to be elevated in this mouse model of maternal obesity and it is known that leptin can alter locomotor activity."},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the relative contributions of risk factors in predicting young children's behavior problems may provide insights for the development of preventive interventions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify maternal predictors of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors in a volunteer sample of 205 low-income, single mothers with children between 2 and 6 years of age. METHOD: Data were collected on chronic stressors, self-esteem, negative thinking, depressive symptoms, and child behavior during in-home interviews with the mothers. RESULTS: Mothers' reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors did not differ by sex or race of the child. Chronic stressors and depressive symptoms, in addition to control variables, explained 27{\%} of the variability in internalizing behavior while these two variables accounted for 21{\%} of the variability in externalizing behavior. For both internalizing and externalizing behavior, chronic stressors exerted the largest total effects. The effects of self-esteem and negative thinking were indirect, with the latter playing a stronger role. The indirect effect of negative thinking on child behavior was exerted through depressive symptoms, while self-esteem was linked with child behavior through both negative thinking and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing mothers' negative thinking, a variable amenable to intervention, may not only decrease a mother's depressive symptoms but also improve her perception of the child's behavior. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Decreasing mothers' negative thinking may provide a way to reduce their depressive symptoms and result in fewer behavior problems among their young children. Nurses working in primary care and community-based settings are in key positions to address this problem and improve the mental health of low-income mothers and positively affect the behavior of their children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide, yet has unclear etiology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: We explored the association between maternal exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution and odds of ASD in her child.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of participants in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II), a prospective cohort of 116,430 U.S. female nurses recruited in 1989, followed by biennial mailed questionnaires. Subjects were NHS II participants' children born 1990-2002 with ASD (n = 245), and children without ASD (n = 1,522) randomly selected using frequency matching for birth years. Diagnosis of ASD was based on maternal report, which was validated against the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised in a subset. Monthly averages of PM with diameters ≤ 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and 2.5-10 $\mu$m (PM10-2.5) were predicted from a spatiotemporal model for the continental United States and linked to residential addresses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of ASD, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for ASD per interquartile range (IQR) higher PM2.5 (4.42 $\mu$g/m3) of 1.57 (95{\%} CI: 1.22, 2.03) among women with the same address before and after pregnancy (160 cases, 986 controls). Associations with PM2.5 exposure 9 months before or after the pregnancy were weaker in independent models and null when all three time periods were included, whereas the association with the 9 months of pregnancy remained (OR = 1.63; 95{\%} CI: 1.08, 2.47). The association between ASD and PM2.5 was stronger for exposure during the third trimester (OR = 1.42 per IQR increase in PM2.5; 95{\%} CI: 1.09, 1.86) than during the first two trimesters (ORs = 1.06 and 1.00) when mutually adjusted. There was little association between PM10-2.5 and ASD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Higher maternal exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy, particularly the third trimester, was associated with greater odds of a child having ASD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCITATION: Raz R, Roberts AL, Lyall K, Hart JE, Just AC, Laden F, Weisskopf MG. 2015.

annote = {A Study Design 
A.1.  What were the objectives of the study? What association was investigated? 
  maternal exposure to PM air pollution in pregnancy and atuism spectrum disorder in child

A.2.  What was the primary outcome of interest? Briefly explain how outcome was measured. Was this accurately measured? 
  autism spectrum disorder (ASD) -- maternal (nurse) report. reported on follow-up questionnaire as well. Subsample of 50 validated by Autism DIagnostic Interview-Revised. Almost all met criteria, others missing one point in one domain. Also validated by Social Responsiveness Scale data on about 90{\%} of eligible cases

A.3.  How was the primary exposure used in the analyses defined by the authors? Briefly explain how this exposure was measured. Was this accurately measured? Was this exposure meant to be a proxy for something else (we'll refer to this something else as the “exposure of interest” below)? Did the exposure measured adequately capture the exposure of interest? Consider time windows, and compounds, etc. 
  assessed based on mailing address during pregnancy, from which monthly exposure predictions were generated from "nationwide expansions of previously validated spatiotemporal models" based on data from the EPA air quality system

A.4.  What type of study was conducted (describe study design)? 
  nested case-control. mothers from Nurses Health Study II who reported children with ASD and controls from the same cohort, matched on birth year

A.5.  What is the study population? What was the population from which the study population was sampled? Describe the process of subject selection and depending on the study design, the ratio of cases:controls (case-control study) or ratio of exposed:unexposed (cohort study). 
  study population = 245 cases and 1522 control mother-child pairs from NHS II whose conception was after June 1989 and who did or did not report ASD in 2005, selected from the 116,430 US female nurses in the entire cohort. controls selected from parous women with no ASD child in 2005, matched on birth year 
  
A.6.  Selection bias: Was subject selection based on the outcome or the exposure of interest? In what ways could the selection based on outcome have differed with respect to the exposure, or the selection based on the exposure have differed with respect to the outcome? Are these likely to have introduced selection bias? 
subject selection was obviously based on outcome because it was a case-control study. the assumption then is that the controls represent the distribution of the exposure that gave rise to the cases. this could be false if, for example, all the control mothers in high PM regions dropped out of the study but all the case mothers in all region stayed in the study. selection bias could also arise if, say, nurses were more likely to drop out of the study if they had a child with ASD and people who live in regions with higher pollution were also more likely to move around and therefore less likely to continue to participate.
  
A.7.  Differential bias: In what ways could the collection of information on exposure have differed with respect to the outcome, or information on outcome have differed with respect to the exposure? Were these likely to have introduced bias? 
  information on the exposure is unlikely related to outcome because it was collected from a model that is agnostic to the child's outcome status. the information on outcome could have differed with respect to the exposure if, for example, children are preferentially diagnosed or mothers preferentially report diagnoses because they know they live in a high-pollution area. it is quite possible that diagnosis differs regionally and that that variation is also related to PM air pollution.

A.8.  Non-differential bias: In what ways could there have been non-differential measurement error in the collection of information on exposure or outcome? 
  there was definitely measurement error of the exposure beacuse it came from a model and we also don't know whether women were truly spending their time at their mailing addresses during pregnancy. there was definitely misclassification of the outcome as seen in the validation study.

A.9.  Confounding: What provisions (study design, subject restrictions, etc.) were made to minimize the influence of external factors prior to the analysis of the data? 
subjects were matched on birth year, all children have mothers who are nurses so presumably somewhat similar SES and health knowledge
  
B  Analysis of Data 
B.1.  What methods were used to control confounding bias? Were these sufficient? 
  multivariable regression models were fit with the following covariates: birth year and month, sex, maternal age at birth, paternal age at birth, median census tract income at birth year. sensitivity analyses with models adjusted for gestational variables, smoking, houe calue in census tract, marital status, husband/partner's education, maternal grndparents education

B.2.  What methods were used to consider effect modification, if any?  
also looked at associations stratified by sex because of suggestions that associations mainly among boys; results slightly stronger in boys, but there were few girls with ASD  

B.3.  What measure of association was reported in this study? How was the stability of the measure of association reported in this study?  
  odds ratio, 95{\%} CIs

C  Interpretation of Data 
C.1. What was the major result of this study? Please provide the major quantitative result. 
PM 2.5 during pregnancy (but not before or after, and not PM 10) asociated with increased odds of ASD.

C.2.  How would the interpretation of this result be affected by the previously mentioned biases (A.6-B.1–include other confounders you might be concerned about)? Discuss both direction and magnitude of any biases if present. 
if the finding were the result of bias, we may expect to see similar findings for the null associations, but we did not. income/house value at the census tract level so may definitely be some reisdual confounding. would have liked to see results with all confounders included at once. unmeasured/included confounders would have to increase both odds of ASD and levels of PM 2.5 to explain away association.
  
C.3. To what larger population may the results of this study be generalized? Justify your restrictions (if any) to the generalization of these results. 
  the general US population. even though nurses of higher SES generally, we probably wouldn't expect the effect of air pollution to vary by SES (though it would on some scale)

C.4.  Did the discussion section adequately address the limitations of the study? How confident are you in the main finding of this study (C.1)? Why?
discussed exposure misclassification for movers as well as time spent at residential address, parental report of ASD. I am omewhat confidence in the main finding given that the other findings were null but would have liked to see more of a discussion of confounding.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and pattern of specific areas of learning disability (LD) in neurologically normal children with extremely low birth weight (ELBW) ({\textless} or = 800 g) who have broadly average intelligence compared with full-term children with normal birth weight of comparable sociodemographic background, and to explore concurrent cognitive correlates of the specific LDs. DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up; geographically defined region. SETTING: Regional follow-up program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, Gray Oral Reading Test-Revised, Test of Written Language-Revised, Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised, Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fourteen (87{\%}) of 131 children with ELBW born between 1982 and 1987 were seen at ages 8 to 9 years. Of the 114 children, 74, who were neurologically normal, with a Verbal or Performance IQ greater than or equal to 85, formed the study group. A group of 30 full-term children with normal birth weight and similar sociodemographic status comprised a comparison group. The children were predominantly white and middle class. RESULTS: Significantly more children with ELBW (65{\%}) met criteria for LD in 1 or more areas compared with 13{\%} of the comparison children. In the ELBW group, the most frequently affected area was written output, then arithmetic, then reading. Visuospatial and visual-motor abilities in combination with verbal functioning primarily explained performance in arithmetic and reading among children with ELBW, unlike the control children, whose scores were associated only with verbal functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Complex LDs in multiple academic domains are common sequelae among broadly middle class, predominantly white, neurologically normal children with ELBW compared with control peers. The developmental etiology of LDs in children with ELBW and control peers differs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous research found that prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) may increase children's vulnerability to behavior and cognition problems. Maturational changes in brain and social development make adolescence an ideal time to reexamine associations. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of published studies examining associations between PCE and adolescent development (behavior, cognition/school outcomes, physiologic responses, and brain morphology/functioning).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Articles were obtained from PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases through July 2012 with search terms: prenatal drug, substance, or cocaine exposure; adolescence/adolescent; and in utero substance/drug exposure. Criteria for inclusion were nonexposed comparison group, human adolescents aged 11 to 19, peer-reviewed, English-language, and adolescent outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Twenty-seven studies representing 9 cohorts met the criteria. Four outcome categories were identified: behavior, cognition/school performance, brain structure/function, and physiologic responses. Eleven examined behavior; 7 found small but significant differences favoring nonexposed adolescents, with small effect sizes. Eight examined cognition/school performance; 6 reported significantly lower scores on language and memory tasks among adolescents with PCE, with varying effect sizes varied. Eight examined brain structure/function and reported morphologic differences with few functional differences. Three examined physiologic responses with discordant findings. Most studies controlled for other prenatal exposures, caregiving environment, and violence exposure; few examined mechanisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings among younger children, PCE increases the risk for small but significantly less favorable adolescent functioning. Although the clinical importance of differences is often unknown, the caregiving environment and violence exposure pose additional threats. Future research should investigate mechanisms linking PCE with adolescent functioning.},

abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Are the levels of biologically active and the most toxic dioxin-like substances in adipose tissue of patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) higher than in a control group without endometriosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: DIE patients have higher levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in adipose tissue compared with controls without endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Some studies have investigated the levels of dioxin-like substances, in serum samples, in patients with endometriosis, with inconsistent results. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Case-control study including two groups of patients. The study group (DIE group) consisted of 30 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery because of DIE. In all patients, an extensive preoperative work-up was performed including clinical exploration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transvaginal sonography. All patients with DIE underwent a confirmatory histological study for DIE after surgery. The non-endometriosis control group (control group), included the next consecutive patient undergoing laparoscopic surgery in our center due to adnexal benign gynecological disease (ovarian or tubal procedures other than endometriosis) after each DIE patient, and who did not present any type of endometriosis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: During the surgical procedure 1-2 g of adipose tissue from the omentum were obtained. Dioxin-like substances were analyzed in adipose tissue in DIE patients and controls without endometriosis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The total toxic equivalence and concentrations of both dioxins and PCBs were significantly higher in patients with DIE in comparison with the control group (P {\textless} 0.05), mainly due to the significantly higher values of the two most toxic dioxins (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [2,3,7,8-TCDD] and 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD]) (P {\textless} 0.01 for each compound). The levels of furan 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF were statistically higher in the DIE group compared with controls. Only four congeners of PCBs had toxic equivalence values and concentrations that were statistically higher in patients with DIE, but these included the most toxic and carcinogenic PCB-126 (PCB-114 P {\textless} 0.05; PCB-156 P {\textless} 0.05; PCB-189 P = 0.04; PCB-126 P {\textless} 0.01). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Since few patients were recruited, the study is only exploratory. Our results need to be confirmed in larger and more heterogeneous population studies since environmental and even genetic factors involved in determining dioxins and PCBs widely vary in different countries. Furthermore, the strict eligibility criteria used may preclude generalization of the results to other populations and the surgery-based sampling frame may induce a selection bias. Finally, adipose tissue was obtained only from the omentum, and not from other adipose tissue of the body. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest a potential role of dioxin-like substances in the pathogenesis of DIE. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: None. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable.},

abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that upon activation by the toxicant 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) stimulates gene expression and toxicity. AHR is also important for normal mouse physiology and may play a role in cancer progression in the absence of environmental toxicants. The objective of this report was to identify AHR-dependent genes (ADGs) whose expression is regulated by AHR in the absence of toxicants. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that AHR regulated the expression of over 600 genes at an FDR{\textless}10{\%} in MCF-7 breast cancer cells upon knockdown with short interfering RNA. Pathway analysis revealed that a significant number of ADGs were components of TCDD and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways. We also demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of AHR modulated TNF induction of MNSOD and cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells. Collectively, the major new findings of this report are: (1) endogenous AHR promotes the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes even in the absence of toxicants and drugs, (2) AHR by modulating the basal expression of a large fraction of TNF target genes may prime them for TNF stimulation and (3) AHR is required for TNF induction of MNSOD and the cellular response to cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells. This latter result provides a potentially new role for AHR in MCF-7 cancer progression as a mediator of TNF and antioxidant responses.},

Regression analyses of child and adult measures of child's emotion self-regulation and callous- unemotional traits, and a child measure of moral emotions, showed that poor emotion regulation, along with low levels of guilt and high levels of shame, predicted children's externalizing behaviors, while only low levels of guilt predicted a unique subset of child characteristics called callous-unemotional traits. Children who experienced healthy guilt for misdeeds were better able to control their behavior. Adults noted the ability of children with callous/ unemotional traits to manage and regulate their emotions, while poor emotion regulation was more predictive of the cluster of externalizing problems. Discussion focuses on prevention efforts aimed at teaching emotion self-regula- tion and the implications of the high levels of callous- unemotional traits in this population of children},

abstract = {Consider a case-control study in which prevalent cases of a given disease define the index series and members of the base population without the disease are sampled to provide the referent series. Information on a set of explanatory variables (eg, genotypes) is collected at great cost for cases and controls. The objective of the study is to evaluate the relationship between case status and the explanatory variables. Subsequently, an investigator notes that the prevalence of a second disease was measured for the members of the index and referent series. The investigator wishes to make efficient use of the available data by assessing the relationship between this second disease and the set of explanatory variables. In this paper, we discuss 2 analytic approaches that might be used to assess associations between the explanatory variables and an outcome other than the original disease. One is through the inclusion of a design variable for original disease status as a covariate; and, the second is through weighted logistic regression using the inverse of the sampling fractions as the weights. The latter approach allows the investigator to derive an estimate of association between the explanatory variables and the second disease without adjustment for the first disease. Weighted logistic regression methods are readily implemented using available statistical packages.},

METHODS: The sample included 370 children (187 probands and 183 siblings) participating in a family genetic study of attention and aggressive behavior problems. Univariate and stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to derive models for predicting two diagnostic conditions: ADHD and ODD/CD. RESULTS: The Attention Problems syndrome significantly predicted ADHD, and ODD/CD was significantly predicted by the Aggressive Behavior syndrome. Both scales demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, as assessed through receiver operating characteristics analyses. Cut-point analyses confirmed the utility of low T-scores, 55 on the respective syndromes, for efficiently discriminating cases from noncases. CONCLUSIONS: CBCL syndromes display good diagnostic efficiency for assessing common externalizing disorders in children.},

Cases were women from the cohort diagnosed with breast cancer between 1984 and 1994.

We categorized 463 cases and 2,201 controls according to history of induced abortion as recorded on the index birth certificate. The risk of breast cancer was not found to be associated with a prior induced abortion (estimated relative risk (RR) = 0.9, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.2). These results suggest that an induced abortion, if followed at some later time by pregnancy and childbirth, does not increase a woman's risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information is needed to understand the role of low to moderate levels of mothers' emotional stress and child characteristics (i.e. prematurity) on parenting behaviours and their impact on children's behaviour that might be deemed 'challenging' but not 'disordered'. METHODS: The direct and indirect relations of maternal childrearing history and emotional stress, and observed parenting practices when children were 3 years of age on 4-year child behavioural outcomes was examined in a sample of low-income families with a term (n=112) or preterm (n=180) child. Parenting practices included displays of warmth and restrictiveness when interacting with their children. Child outcomes at 4 years included observation of social initiations with their mothers and maternal report of social and attentional problems. RESULTS: A Structural Equation Model building approach guided by specific hypotheses indicated that preterm as compared to full-term children had more maternal reported social and attentional problems but did not differ in observed social initiating skills. Greater negative maternal childrearing history indirectly influenced social initiating skills through its direct influence on maternal emotional stress. Greater maternal emotional stress directly influenced mothers' parenting that, in turn, directly influenced social initiating. Prematurity and a more negative childrearing history had a direct negative influence on the maternal report of social and attentional behavioural outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings delineate the effects of prematurity and maternal parenting on the behaviour of 4-year-old-children and extend current knowledge of the influence of parental emotional stress on parenting. Even milder levels can negatively influence parenting, and in turn, contribute to children's less well developed social skills. The issues raised in this study could help with the identification and prioritization of medical and psychological services.},

"The final model supported our hypothesis for the indirect influence of negative childrearing histories and stress on the positive child behavioural outcome, social initiating skills. Mothers who recalled more harsh and neglecting memories of how they were parented were more likely to report higher levels of emotional stress. Mothers with higher levels of emotional stress displayed less warmth and flexibility in interactions with their children and, ultimately, their children displayed fewer bids for adults' attention. Thus, mothers who experience only mild to moderate levels of loneliness and anxiety appear to have difficulty responding sensitively to their children's needs and interest. Children who experience this parenting style may learn over time that bids for attention are not met positively and therefore decrease exhibiting this behaviour over time."
"Our results regarding lower levels of warm responsiveness for mothers with moderate levels of stress are consistent with studies documenting that severe mental health symptoms can undermine parenting behaviours and contribute to children's behaviour disorders."
"This model also supports a corss-generationla transmission of poor parenting skills based on the influence of mothers' own parenting histories on their parenting behaviours, a belief that is commonly held but more difficult to document empirically."
direct, not indirect path between mom's emotional stress and poor maternal report of behavior:
"this finding may also suggest that emotionally stressed mothers are more likely to report that their children have difficult behaviours."
"the negative impact of maternal emotional distress is transmitted directly to child behaviour problems but indirectly, via parenting, to child social initiating."},

Thus, the objective of the present study was to assess the effects of maternal HIV infection, nutritional status and obstetric history, and season of birth on gestation length and birth size. The study population was 1669 antenatal care attendees in Harare, Zimbabwe. A prospective cohort study was conducted as part of a randomised, controlled trial. Maternal anthropometry, age, gravidity, and HIV status and load were assessed in 22nd-35th weeks gestation. Outcomes were gestation length and birth size. Birth data were available from 1106 (66.3{\%}) women, of which 360 (32.5{\%}) had HIV infection. Mean gestation length was 39.1 weeks with 16.6{\%} {\textless}37 weeks, mean birth weight was 3030 g with 10.5{\%} {\textless}2500 g. Gestation length increased with age in primigravidae, but not multigravidae (interaction, P=0.005), and birth in the early dry season, low arm fat area, multiple pregnancies and maternal HIV load were negative predictors. Birth weight increased with maternal height, and birth in the late rainy and early dry season; primi-secundigravidity, low arm fat area, HIV load, multiple pregnancies and female sex were negative predictors. In conclusion, gestation length and birth weight decline with increasing maternal HIV load. In addition, season of birth, gravidity, maternal height and body fat mass, and infant sex are predictors of birth weight.},

abstract = {Objective To evaluate cardiovascular and metabolic features of offspring conceived by in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI). Design Literature review and meta-analysis. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) Offspring from IVF-ICSI versus natural conception. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), cardiovascular function, body mass index (BMI), and lipid and glucose profiles. Result(s) We included 19 studies that had recruited 2,112 IVF-ICSI and 4,096 naturally conceived offspring, ranging from childhood to early adulthood. The blood pressure levels of IVF-ICSI offspring were statistically significantly higher than those of naturally conceived offspring (weighted mean differences and confidence intervals: 1.88 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, 0.27, 3.49] for SBP and 1.51 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, 0.33, 2.70] for DBP). In addition, cardiac diastolic function was suboptimal and vessel thickness was higher among IVF-ICSI offspring. Compared with the metabolism of naturally conceived offspring, IVF-ICSI offspring displayed comparable BMI, lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and higher fasting insulin levels. Conclusion(s) Children conceived by IVF-ICSI manifested a minor yet statistically significant increase in blood pressure without the clustering of increased BMI or impaired lipid metabolism by early adulthood. Our findings indicate a risk of cardiovascular disease among IVF-ICSI offspring, which calls for longer-term follow-ups and further investigation.},

Body weight was measured at prenatal visits and 1 y postpartum. Weight retained and major weight gain (4.55 kg) at 1 y postpartum were the main outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nANALYSIS: Linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Women were on average 1.51+/-5.95 kg heavier at 1 y postpartum than they were in early pregnancy. Nearly 25{\%} of women experienced a major weight gain of 4.55 kg or more at 1 y postpartum. Gestational weight gain, exercise frequency, change in food intake and breastfeeding were each significantly related to postpartum weight retention. With the exception of breastfeeding, all of these factors were also associated with major weight gain. Women under 20 y or over 40 y at delivery, and single women retained significantly more weight. Lower income women with gestational weight gains above the Institute of Medicine (IOM) range retained 3.73 kg more than lower income women who gained within the range. They were also 4.7 times more likely to experience major weight gain with childbearing. The impact of exceeding the IOM gestational weight gain guidelines was three times greater in lower income women than it was in higher income women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Gestational weight gain, postpartum exercise frequency, and food intake are significantly associated with weight change from early pregnancy to 1 y postpartum and major weight gain with childbearing. Lower income women who gain more weight in pregnancy than the IOM recommends are at high risk for major weight gain with childbearing.},

abstract = {Nutrientsandgrowthfactors regulate braindevelopmentduring fetal and early postnatal life. The rapidly developing brain is more vul- nerable to nutrient insufficiency yet also demonstrates its greatest degree of plasticity. Certain nutrients have greater effects on brain development than do others. These include protein, energy, certain fats, iron, zinc, copper, iodine, selenium, vitamin A, choline, and folate. The effect of any nutrient deficiency or overabundance on brain development will be governed by the principle of timing, dose, and duration. The ability to detect the specific effects of nutrient deficiencies is dependent on knowing which area of the brain is preferentially affected and on having neurologic assessments that tap into the functions of those specific areas. As examples, protein- energy malnutrition causes both global deficits, which are testable by general developmental testing, and area-specific effects on the hippocampus and the cortex. Iron deficiency alters myelination, monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis, and hippocampal energy metabolism in the neonatal period. Assessments of these effects could include tests for speed of processing (myelination), changes in motor and affect (monoamines), and recognition memory (hip- pocampus). Zinc deficiency alters autonomic nervous system regu- lation and hippocampal and cerebellar development. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are important for synaptogenesis, mem- brane function, and, potentially, myelination. Overall, circuit- specific behavioral and neuroimaging tests are being developed for use in progressively younger infants to more accurately assess the effect of nutrient deficits both while the subject is deficient and after recovery from the deficiency.},

"The effect of any nutrient deficiency or overabundance on brain development will be governed by the principle of timing, dose, and duration."

"On balance, the brain's vulnerability to nutritional insults likely outweighs its plasticity, which explains why early nutritional insults result in brain dysfunction not only while the nutrient is in deficit, but also after repletion."

"The effect of nutrient deficiency or supplementation on the developing brain is a function of the brain's requirement for a nutrient in specific metabolic pathways and structural components"

"The hippocampus that subserves recognition memory behavior is one of the earliest areas to show cortical-cortical connectivity and functionality"

"Nutrients are necessary not only for neurons but also for supporting glial cells. For any given region, early nutritional insults have a greater effect on cell proliferation, thereby affecting cell number. Later nutritional insults affect differentiation, including size, complexity, and in the case of neurons, synaptogenesis and dendritic arborization."

abstract = {Maternal injuries during pregnancy are common (a7{\%} prevalence). However, few studies have examined the association between maternal injuries and birth defects. The National Birth Defects Prevention Study is a population-based case-control study of birth defects in 10 US states. Cases were ascertained through surveillance; controls were randomly selected from infants delivered without major birth defects in the study regions. Mothers completed a telephone interview on exposures before and during pregnancy, including injuries. We assessed associations between periconceptional (month before until the end of the third month of pregnancy) maternal injuries and birth defects. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI). Periconceptional injuries were associated with interrupted aortic arch type B [AOR = 5.2, 95{\%} CI 1.2, 23.2]; atrioventricular septal defect [AOR = 2.2, 95{\%} CI 1.1, 4.4]; pulmonary atresia [AOR = 3.2, 95{\%} CI 1.6, 6.4]; tricuspid atresia [AOR = 2.8, 95{\%} CI 1.2, 6.7]; hypoplastic left heart syndrome [AOR = 2.0, 95{\%} CI 1.1, 3.4]; anorectal atresia/stenosis [AOR = 1.7, 95{\%} CI 1.0, 2.7]; longitudinal limb deficiency [AOR = 2.1, 95{\%} CI 1.1, 3.9]; and gastroschisis [AOR = 1.8, 95{\%} CI 1.2, 2.8]. Associations with longitudinal limb deficiency, gastroschisis and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were stronger for intentional injuries. Our results suggest maternal injury during the periconceptional period, particularly those inflicted intentionally, may be associated with select birth defects. This analysis was hypothesis-generating, with many associations tested. Further research is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite the recent flourishing of mediation analysis techniques, many modern approaches are difficult to implement or applicable to only a restricted range of regression models. This report provides practical guidance for implementing a new technique utilizing inverse odds ratio weighting (IORW) to estimate natural direct and indirect effects for mediation analyses. IORW takes advantage of the odds ratio's invariance property and condenses information on the odds ratio for the relationship between the exposure (treatment) and multiple mediators, conditional on covariates, by regressing exposure on mediators and covariates. The inverse of the covariate-adjusted exposure-mediator odds ratio association is used to weight the primary analytical regression of the outcome on treatment. The treatment coefficient in such a weighted regression estimates the natural direct effect of treatment on the outcome, and indirect effects are identified by subtracting direct effects from total effects. Weighting renders treatment and mediators independent, thereby deactivating indirect pathways of the mediators. This new mediation technique accommodates multiple discrete or continuous mediators. IORW is easily implemented and is appropriate for any standard regression model, including quantile regression and survival analysis. An empirical example is given using data from the Moving to Opportunity (1994-2002) experiment, testing whether neighborhood context mediated the effects of a housing voucher program on obesity. Relevant Stata code (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) is provided.},

Subjects were selected from the Toyama study. Matched-pair comparisons were performed between obese children whose Kaup's index was 18 or more (N=117) and control children (N=234) . Multivariate stepwised logistic regression analysis also applied to assess influence of confounding factors.The results indicated that the following 6 factors significantly influenced the development of obese 3-year-old children in exact Fisher's method analysis (p{\textless}0.05): person other than the mother responsible for taking care of the child, short sleep duration (9 hours or less), physical inactivity, eating snacks irregularly, overweight father (BMI≥24), and overweight mother (BMI≥24).

abstract = {Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a leading cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics and behaviors of mothers of children with FAS in the United States using population-based data from the FAS Surveillance Network (FASSNet). FASSNet used a multiple source methodology that identified FAS cases through passive reporting and active review of records from hospitals, specialty clinics, private physicians, early intervention programs, Medicaid, birth certificates and other vital records, birth defects surveillance programs, and hospital discharge data. The surveillance included children born during January 1, 1995-December 31, 1997. In the four states included in our analysis - Arizona, New York, Alaska, and Colorado - there were 257 confirmed cases and 96 probable cases for a total of 353 FAS cases. Compared to all mothers in the states where surveillance occurred, mothers of children with FAS were significantly more likely to be older, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Black, not Hispanic, unmarried, unemployed, and without prenatal care, to smoke during pregnancy, to have a lower educational level, and to have more live born children. A significant proportion of mothers (9-29{\%}) had another child with suspected alcohol effects. Compared to all US mothers, they were also significantly more likely to be on public assistance, to be on Medicaid at their child's birth, to have received treatment for alcohol abuse, to have confirmed alcoholism, to have used marijuana or cocaine during pregnancy, to have their baby screen positive for alcohol or drugs at birth, to have had an induced abortion, to have had a history of mental illness, to have been involved in binge drinking during pregnancy, and to have drunk heavily (7 days/week) during pregnancy. These findings suggest that it is possible to identify women who are at high risk of having a child with FAS and target these women for interventions.},
annote = {
"One noteworthy finding was that, in Alaska, nearly 1 in 3 mothers of children with FAS had another child with suspected alcohol effects."


"Our findings suggest taht it is possible to identify women who may be at highest risk of having a child with FAS. Given that, it is possible to target interventions aimed at reducing behaviors that can lead to the birth of a child with FAS. Interventions might have the biggest impact if they are embedded in systems serving women who are older, racial/ethnic minorities, unmarried, unemployed, on Medicaid, or of lower educational level."

abstract = {In the province of Manitoba, the incidence of preterm birth has been increasing and the rate is higher among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal women. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth in Manitoba women, and to compare risk factors among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women. A case-control study was performed at two tertiary care hospitals in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from October 1999 to December 2000. Cases delivered a live singleton infant at {\textless} 37 weeks gestation (n = 226; 36{\%} Aboriginal), while controls delivered between 37 and 42 weeks gestation (n = 458; 38{\%} Aboriginal). An interview was conducted with each subject on the postpartum unit, and information was collected from the health record. Using stratified analyses to control for race/ethnicity, several risk factors for preterm birth had a uniform effect measure across strata, while others demonstrated heterogeneity. After adjusting for other maternal characteristics in a multivariable logistic regression model, significant risk factors for all women included previous preterm birth, two or more previous spontaneous abortions, vaginal bleeding after 12 weeks gestation, gestational hypertension, antenatal hospitalisation, and prelabour rupture of membranes. In addition, potentially modifiable risk factors included low weight gain during pregnancy and inadequate prenatal care for all women, and high levels of perceived stress for Aboriginal women. These modifiable risk factors lend themselves to public health interventions, and should be targeted in future prevention efforts.},

The issues are illustrated in a sensitivity analysis of confounding in a study of residential wire code and childhood leukemia and in a pooled analysis of 12 studies of magnetic-field measurements and childhood leukemia. Both analyses have been interpreted as evidence in favor of a causal effect of magnetic fields on leukemia risk. This interpretation is contrasted with results from analyses based on prior distributions for the unidentified bias parameters used in the original sensitivity-analysis model. These analyses indicate that accounting for uncontrolled confounding and response bias under a reasonable prior can substantially alter inferences about the existence of a magnetic-field effect. More generally, analyses with informative priors for unidentified bias parameters can help avoid misinterpretation of conventional results and ordinary sensitivity analyses.},

abstract = {Birthweight distributions have been conceptualized as a predominant Gaussian distribution contaminated in the tails by an unspecified 'residual' distribution. Acknowledging this idea, we propose a technique for measuring certain features of birthweight distributions useful to epidemiologists: the mean and variance of the predominant distribution; the proportions of births in the low- and high-birthweight residual distributions, and the boundaries of support for these  residual distributions. Our technique, based on an underlying multinomial sampling distribution, involves estimating parameters in a mixture model for the  multinomial bin probabilities after having chosen the support of the residual distribution with a model selection criterion. A modest simulation study and experience with a few actual datasets indicate that use of a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as model selection criterion is superior to use of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) in this application.},
annote = {“While these two components may oversimplify the biology underlying the birthweight distribution, epidemiologists find the description useful”


Consequently, one can use the fraction of births in this residual distribution as a measure of risk for any population of births, even when information on infant survival is unavailable.”

 

“The term ‘residual' derives drom the notion of births remaining the the lower tail after having fit a predominant distribution to the data

 

“Assume that we have k + 1 bins formed by k cutpoints where we regard the lowest and highest bins as unbounded to the left and right, respectively. We model bin probabilities as a mixture of two components: a predominant distribution that contributes to all bins and an unspecified residual distribution{\ldots}..contraminated bins intersect the support of the residual bins intersect the support of the residual component and uncontaminated bins are disjoint from its support.

 

then use a model selecting procedure

 

AIC and BIC (8) the maximum value of the likelihood function minus a penalty that depends on the number of fitted parameters; for BIC, the penalty is the number of fitted parameters times have the natural logarithm of the total number of observations. Consequently, for any sample size larger than eight, BIC favours modeslw tih fewer parameters.

 

To select a model is to decide which bins are contaminated.

 

uniform distribution as the contamination{\ldots}. These proportions and boundaries are reasonable for actual data, and, whereas strict uniformity seems unlikely, what simple shape might be more realistic is unclear.

 

With this bin configuration (500g), neither the uppwer nor the lower tail residual is uniform

 

should use 200 g bins

prefer AIC-selected estimates when the number of births is 5000 or fewer since AIC appears less biased and both methods seem to have comparable variability},

abstract = {et al. reported age-specific hazard ratios for the contrasts in mortality rates between obesity categories. They corrected the observed hazard ra-tios for selection bias caused by what they postulated was the nonrepresentativeness of the participants in the Na-tional Health Interview Study that increased with age, obesity, and ill health. However, it is possible that their regression approach to remove the alleged bias has not produced, and in general cannot produce, sensible hazard ratio estimates. First, one must consider how many nonparticipants there might have been in each category of obes-ity and of age at entry and how much higher the mortality rates would have to be in nonparticipants than in partici-pants in these same categories. What plausible set of numerical values would convert the (" biased ") decreasing-with-age hazard ratios seen in the data into the (" unbiased ") increasing-with-age ratios that they computed? Can these values be encapsulated in (and can sensible values be recovered from) 1 additional internal variable in a re-gression model? Second, one must examine the age pattern of the hazard ratios that have been adjusted for selec-tion. Without the correction, the hazard ratios are attenuated with increasing age. With it, the hazard ratios at older ages are considerably higher, but those at younger ages are well below 1. Third, one must test whether the regres-sion approach suggested by Masters et al. would correct the nonrepresentativeness that increased with age and ill health that I introduced into real and hypothetical data sets. I found that the approach did not recover the hazard ra-tio patterns present in the unselected data sets: The corrections overshot the target at older ages and undershot it at lower ages.},

abstract = {Introduction: Besides dental and skeletal fluorosis, excessive fluoride intake can also affect the central nervous system without first causing the physical deformities associated with skeletal fluorosis. With the existence of widespread endemic fluorosis in India, the possible adverse effect of elevated fluoride in drinking water on the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) level of children is a potentially serious public health problem. Aims and Objectives: This study assessed the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of school going children aged 10-12 years in villages of Mysore district with different fluoride levels. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 405 school children aged 10- 12 years were selected from three villages in Mysore district with normal fluoride (1.20 mg F/l), low fluoride (0.40 mg F/l) and high fluoride (2.20 mg F/l) in their water supplies. A pre designed questionnaire was used to collect the required data for the survey which included socio demographic details, oral hygiene practices, diet history, body mass index and dental fluorosis. Intelligence Quotient was assessed using Raven's colored Progressive Matrices Test. Results: In bivariate analysis, significant relationships were found between water fluoride levels and Intelligence Quotient of school children (P {\textless} 0.05). In the high fluoride village, the proportion of children with IQ below 90, i.e. below average IQ was larger compared to normal and low fluoride village. Age, gender, parent education level and family income had no significant association with IQ. Conclusion: School children residing in area with higher than normal water fluoride level demonstrated more impaired development of intelligence when compared to school children residing in areas with normal and low water fluoride levels. Thus, children's intelligence can be affected by high water fluoride levels.},

To examine the complex relations between emotional, cognitive and motivational aspects of learning, appropriate measures of emotion regulation in an academic context are mandatory. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a psychometrically sound and contextually specific multidimensional self-report instrument aimed at assessing the specific emotion regulation strategies that students predominantly implement in various academic situations. Based on the theoretical assumptions of the process model of emotion regulation and a series of four empirical studies conducted on separate samples of high-school and university students (N1 = 20, N2 = 1030, N3 = 359 and N4 = 230), by combining both qualitative and quantitative data, the Academic Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (AERQ) was designed. The instrument contains 8 scales, each measuring a separate emotion regulation strategy: avoiding situations, developing competences, redirecting attention, reappraisal, suppression, respiration, venting, and seeking social support. All scales had adequate psychometric characteristics and were meaningfully related to the external variables examined (i.e. gender, cognitive appraisals, achievement emotions, academic achievement and goal orientations).},

Study design We studied cases of gastroschisis ascertained from the regional fetal congenital anomaly register. We compared each affected mother with two controls from the birth register and maternity database. The first control was the next mother to deliver in the hospital, representing the normal population of mothers. The second control was the next mother to deliver an unaffected child whose age was within one year of that of the index case controlling for maternal age. Results There was a strong inverse association between maternal age and gastroschisis. An inverse association between gastroschisis and birth order was eliminated by adjustment for maternal age. The average age of mothers of affected children was 22.1 years; of the next delivery control was 28.8 years, and of the age matched control was 22.2 years. A weak non-statistically significant negative association between BMI and gastroschisis was further weakened by adjustment for maternal age. Conclusion Our results confirm the previously reported association between low maternal age and gastroschisis but suggest that within our UK population the link between low BMI and gastroschisis reported elsewhere is explained by younger mothers being thinner.},

abstract = {We consider four classes of graphical causal models: the Finest Fully Randomized Causally Interpretable Structured Tree Graph (FFRCISTG) of Robins (1986), the agnostic causal model of Spirtes et al. (1993), the Non-Parametric Structural Equation Model (NPSEM) of Pearl (2000), and the Minimal Counterfactual Model (MCM) which we introduce. The latter is referred to as ‘minimal' because it imposes the minimal counterfactual independence assumptions required to identify those causal contrasts representing the effect of an ideal intervention on any subset of the variables in the graph. The causal contrasts identified by an MCM are, in general, a strict subset of those identified by a NPSEM associated with the same graph. We analyze various measures of the ‘direct' causal effect, focussing on the pure direct effect (PDE), also called the ‘natural direct effect'. We show the PDE is a parameter that may be identified in a DAG viewed as a NPSEM, but not as an MCM. In spite of this, Pearl has given a scenario in which the PDE corresponds to the intent-to-treat parameter of a randomized experiment. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that implicit within Pearl's account is an extended causal DAG with additional variables in which there is a causal contrast that equals the pure direct effect of Pearl's original NPSEM. Further, this contrast is identified from observational data on the original variables. Finally we relate our results to the work of Avin et al. (2005) on path-specific causal effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fully understanding the determinants and sequelae of fetal growth requires a continuous measure of birth weight adjusted for gestational age. Published United States reference data, however, provide estimates only of the median and lowest and highest 5th and 10th percentiles for birth weight at each gestational age. The purpose of our analysis was to create more continuous reference measures of birth weight for gestational age for use in epidemiologic analyses. METHODS: We used data from the most recent nationwide United States Natality datasets to generate multiple reference percentiles of birth weight at each completed week of gestation from 22 through 44 weeks. Gestational age was determined from last menstrual period. We analyzed data from 6,690,717 singleton infants with recorded birth weight and sex born to United States resident mothers in 1999 and 2000. RESULTS: Birth weight rose with greater gestational age, with increasing slopes during the third trimester and a leveling off beyond 40 weeks. Boys had higher birth weights than girls, later born children higher weights than firstborns, and infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers higher birth weights than those born to non-Hispanic black mothers. These results correspond well with previously published estimates reporting limited percentiles. CONCLUSIONS: Our method provides comprehensive reference values of birth weight at 22 through 44 completed weeks of gestation, derived from broadly based nationwide data. Other approaches require assumptions of normality or of a functional relationship between gestational age and birth weight, which may not be appropriate. These data should prove useful for researchers investigating the predictors and outcomes of altered fetal growth.},

abstract = {Case histories are presented of 8 unrelated children born to mothers who were chronic alcoholics.  These children showed a similar pattern of craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal-onset growth deficiency and developmental delay.  This is the 1st report to document an association between maternal alcoholism and aberrant morphogenesis in the offspring.  The mean duration of maternal alcoholism was 9.4 years.  3 of the cases were black, 3 were Native American, and 2 were white.  The mean gestational age was 38 weeks.  The degree of linear growth deficiency was more severe than the deficit of weight at birth, suggesting that a factor other than maternal undernutrition alone affected prenatal growth.  Developmental delay, prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and short palbebral fissures were observed in all 8 children.  7 of the 8 children also demonstrated microcephaly and maxillary hypoplasia with relative prognathism.  6 had an altered palmar crease pattern, 5 showed cardiac and joint anomalies, and 4 had epicanthal folds.  Although adequate nutrition was provided to the children during hospital admission and/or foster care placement, no catch-up growth was observed.  After 1 year, the average linear growth rate was 65{\%} of normal and the average rate of weight gain was only 38{\%} of normal.  By 1 year, head circumference fell below the 3rd percentile for height and chronological age in 5 of the 6 children in whom measurements were taken.  Fine motor dysfunction was present in 5 of the 6 children tested, and most were delayed in gross motor performance as well.  The similarity in pattern of malformation noted among these 8 children suggests a singular mode of etiology related to an as yet unknown effect of maternal alcoholism.  Direct ethanol toxicity is the most likely possibility.},

STUDY DESIGN: Pregnancy outcome and occupational exposures were collected retrospectively from 8461 participants of the Nurses' Health Study II. Of these, 7482 were eligible for analysis using logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants reported 6707 live births, and 775 (10{\%}) spontaneous abortions ({\textless}20 weeks). After adjusting for age, parity, shift work, and hours worked, antineoplastic drug exposure was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of spontaneous abortion, particularly with early spontaneous abortion before the 12th week, and 3.5-fold increased risk among nulliparous women. Exposure to sterilizing agents was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of late spontaneous abortion (12-20 weeks), but not with early spontaneous abortion. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that certain occupational exposures common to nurses are related to risks of spontaneous abortion.},

abstract = {Background: Heckman-type selection models have been used to control HIV prevalence estimates for selection bias when participation in HIV testing and HIV status are associated after controlling for observed variables. These models typically rely on the strong assumption that the error terms in the participation and the outcome equations that comprise the model are distributed as bivariate normal. Methods: We introduce a novel approach for relaxing the bivariate normality assumption in selection models using copula functions. We apply this method to estimating HIV prevalence and new confidence intervals (CI) in the 2007 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) by using interviewer identity as the selection variable that predicts participation (consent to test) but not the outcome (HIV status). Results: We show in a simulation study that selection models can generate biased results when the bivariate normality assumption is violated. In the 2007 Zambia DHS, HIV prevalence estimates are similar irrespective of the structure of the association assumed between participation and outcome. For men, we estimate a population HIV prevalence of 21{\%} (95{\%} CI = 16{\%}–25{\%}) compared with 12{\%} (11{\%}–13{\%}) among those who consented to be tested; for women, the corresponding figures are 19{\%} (13{\%}–24{\%}) and 16{\%} (15{\%}–17{\%}). Conclusions: Copula approaches to Heckman-type selection models are a useful addition to the methodological toolkit of HIV epidemiology and of epidemiology in general. We develop the use of this approach to systematically evaluate the robustness of HIV prevalence estimates based on selection models, both empirically and in a simulation study.},

We conducted a prospective study of a general population sample of those born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between April 1, 1972, and March 30, 1973 (95.4{\%} retention of cohort after 38 years of prospective follow-up). Residence in a CWF area, use of fluoride dentifrice and intake of 0.5-milligram fluoride tablets were assessed in early life (prior to age 5 years); we assessed IQ repeatedly between ages 7 to 13 years and at age 38 years. Results. No significant differences in IQ because of fluoride exposure were noted. These findings held after adjusting for potential confounding variables, including sex, socioeconomic status, breastfeeding, and birth weight (as well as educational attainment for adult IQ outcomes). Conclusions. These findings do not support the assertion that fluoride in the context of CWF programs is neurotoxic. Associations between very high fluoride exposure and low IQ reported in previous studies may have been affected by confounding, particularly by urban or rural status. (Am J Public Health.

More recently it has been shown that stratifying on a variable that precedes exposure and disease can induce confounding, even if there is no confounding in the unstratified (crude) estimate. This paper examines the relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models in which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables affected by exposure and disease may often be comparable in size with bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the pattern of weight perception and its relationship with psychological distress among Chinese adolescents. METHODS: A sub-cohort of 2179 healthy Chinese adolescents randomly selected from schools in Wuhan, China, including 1156 boys and 1023 girls 11 to 15 years of age was included in the current study. Weight, height, self-perceptions of weight status, depressive psychological symptoms including anxiety, depression, perceived peer isolation, and other constructs were measured by a structured questionnaire. A General Linear Model was used to compare psychological differences between actual and perceived weight groups. RESULTS: Perceived underweight was more likely to occur in boys, whereas perceived overweight was more likely to occur in girls. Compared with objective body weight status defined by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) cutoffs, girls were more likely to misperceive themselves as overweight, whereas relatively more boys misclassified their weight status as underweight. After adjusting for age, parents' educational attainment, and urban residence, perceived overweight boys and girls were more likely to experience anxiety and depression than perceived normal and underweight subjects (p {\textless}.05). Perceived overweight girls and perceived underweight boys experienced higher peer isolation than other groups (p {\textless}.05). Significant differences were not found in social support, school connectedness, trouble with teachers, and family disharmony among different weight-perception groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested distortion of weight perception was prevalent, and may have detrimental psychological influences in Chinese adolescents},

abstract = {Background: Primary prevention efforts for both gastroschisis and omphalocele are limited by the lack of known risk factors. Our objective was to investigate associations between potential maternal risk factors and gastroschisis and omphalocele within a large population-based sample of participants enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). Methods: Demographic, health-related, and environmental exposure data from the NBDPS were collected from women with expected delivery dates between October 1997 and December 2003. Data were collected on 485 cases of gastroschisis, 168 cases of omphalocele, and 4967 controls. Results: Women who had offspring with gastroschisis were younger (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.84; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.86) and less likely to be black (AOR, 0.54; 95{\%} CI, 0.34-0.85) than controls. They also were more likely to have smoked (AOR, 1.51; 95{\%} CI, 1.12-2.03), taken ibuprofen (AOR, 1.61; 95{\%} CI, 1.23-2.10), and consumed alcohol (AOR, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-1.79) than controls. Women who had offspring with omphaloceles were more likely to have consumed alcohol (AOR, 1.53; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-2.25) and be heavy smokers (AOR, 4.26; 95{\%} CI, 1.58-11.52) than controls. Conclusions: Our results suggest a moderately increased risk of gastroschisis among women who used tobacco, alcohol, and ibuprofen during early pregnancy. A modestly elevated risk was observed for omphaloceles among women who used alcohol during the first trimester and among women who were heavy smokers. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Estimates of additive interaction from case-control data are often obtained by logistic regression; such models can also be used to adjust for covariates. This approach to estimating additive interaction has come under some criticism because of possible misspecification of the logistic model: If the underlying model is linear, the logistic model will be misspecified. The authors propose an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach to causal effects and additive interaction in case-control studies. Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, the approach amounts to fitting a marginal structural linear odds model. The approach allows for the estimation of measures of additive interaction between dichotomous exposures, such as the relative excess risk due to interaction, using case-control data without having to rely on modeling assumptions for the outcome conditional on the exposures and covariates. Rather than using conditional models for the outcome, models are instead specified for the exposures conditional on the covariates. The approach is illustrated by assessing additive interaction between genetic and environmental factors using data from a case-control study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of data from rural Gambia has previously shown that being born during the annual hungry season strongly influences susceptibility to mortality from infectious disease in young adulthood, possibly through an influence on immune function. In rural Bangladesh pregnancies are exposed to similar seasonality. The current paper uses data from a large demographic survey in the Matlab region of Bangladesh to retest the Gambian-derived hypothesis that early life exposures correlated with season of birth predict later patterns of mortality. METHODS: Since 1966, a continuous demographic surveillance system has been in operation in the rural Matlab region of Bangladesh. The current analysis is based on 172 228 births and 24 697 deaths between 1974 and 2000. Season of birth was defined as 'harvest' (January-June) and 'hungry' (July-December), based on monthly variations in rates of conception and neonatal mortality within the same dataset. RESULTS: Birth during the hungry season resulted in excess mortality during the first year of life. However, for adult mortality (deaths {\textgreater}15 years), there was no excess in individuals born during the annual hungry season: ratio of hazard July-December versus January-June = 1.12; 95{\%} CI: 0.87, 1.45. CONCLUSIONS: The current study found no excess mortality in young adults born during the 'hungry' season in rural Bangladesh. This differing pattern in survival when compared with The Gambia may be a consequence of the greatly reduced incidence of young adult deaths in Bangladesh (0.1{\%}) compared with The Gambia (3{\%}). Under such conditions possible differences in immune function may not be detectable with early adult death as the outcome. However, it also remains possible that our Gambian observation could be a highly discrete phenomenon localized in either time or place, and as such, will not be replicated in other populations.},

abstract = {Researchers often conduct mediation analysis in order to indirectly assess the effect of a proposed cause on some outcome through a proposed mediator. The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature.

We undertook a registry-based analysis with minimal selection bias and prospective record-based ascertainment of terminations. The source population comprised Massachusetts women with a record of giving birth between 1987 and 1999 in the Massachusetts Vital Statistics Registry. Primary breast cancer cases were 25-55 years old at diagnosis between 1988 and 2000 and had a record of the diagnosis in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry. We matched 3 controls to each case on maternal age, year of giving birth and birth facility. Information on terminations (induced and spontaneous) before the birth of record, the matched factors and potential confounders were collected from the birth certificate. After adjustment for the matched factors, age, parity and maternal and paternal education, the odds ratio associating any termination history with breast cancer risk equaled 0.91 (95{\%} CI = 0.79-1.05). The marginally protective adjusted odds ratio largely derived from a protective effect among women with parity equaled to 1 (OR for any termination = 0.68; 95{\%} CI = 0.45-1.03), suggesting a protective effect of terminated pregnancy among women with one live birth.},

abstract = {A 5-year, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) primary prevention study was conducted in Washington State to: (1) assess the feasibility of using a FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic as a centre for identifying and targeting primary prevention intervention to high-risk women (namely women who had given birth to a child with FAS); (2) generate a comprehensive, lifetime profile of these women; (3) identify factors that have enhanced and/or hindered their ability to achieve abstinence. The results of this study are presented in two parts: work on objective 1 is summarized in the present paper; whereas that on objectives 2 and 3 is summarized in the accompanying paper. This project demonstrated that a multidisciplinary FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN) clinic could successfully attract and meet the diagnostic and treatment planning needs of patients presenting with prenatal alcohol exposure. One out of every three patients evaluated in the FAS DPN clinics was diagnosed with FAS or static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed. The birth mothers of one out of every three of these children diagnosed with FAS or static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed could be located and directly contacted. Half of the birth mothers directly contacted were still at risk for producing more children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Thus, one out of every 18 children evaluated in the FAS DPN clinics had a birth mother who could be found and was at risk of producing more children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Primary prevention programmes targeted to this high-risk population could lead to measurable, cost-effective reductions in the incidence of FAS. Using this approach, the cost of raising a child with FAS would be roughly 30 times the cost of preventing FAS in the child. The benefit to the children, their mothers, and society would be immeasurable.},

The results of controlled studies have been contradictory, leading to confusion, and, possible, misinformation and misperception of teratogenic risk. Objective: To systematically review available data on pregnancy outcome when the mother consumed cocaine. Methods: A meta-analysis of all epidemiologic studies based on a priori criteria was conducted. Comparisons of adverse events in subgroups of exposed vs. unexposed children were performed. Analyses were based on several exposure groups: mainly cocaine, cocaine plus polydrug, polydrug but no cocaine, and drug free. Results: Thirty three studies met our inclusion criteria. For all end points of interest (rates of major malformations, low birth weight, prematurity, placental abruption, premature rupture of membrane [PROM], and mean birth weight, length and head circumference), cocaine-exposed infants had higher risks than children of women not exposed to any drug. However, most of these adverse effects were nullified when cocaine exposed children were compared to children exposed to polydrug but no cocaine. Only the risk of placental abruption and premature rupture of membranes were statistically associated with cocaine use itself. Conclusions: Many of the perinatal adverse effects commonly attributed to cocaine may be caused by the multiple confounders that can occur in a cocaine using mother. Only the risk for placental abruption and PROM could be statistically related to cocaine. For other adverse effects, additional studies will be needed to ensure adequate statistical power.},

abstract = {Gastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect, thought by many to represent a disruption in intrauterine blood flow, where there is herniation of abdominal organs. Dietary intake is an important environmental factor that has been implicated in the development of many diseases. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are nutrients that are substrates for eicosanoid and cytokine synthesis and prone to oxidation, and play a role in modulating inflammation, immune function, and vascular system development. This pilot case-control study explored the association of dietary intake of the omega-6 PUFA linoleic acid with risk of gastroschisis. Between 2008 and 2011, we recruited 13 pregnant women in mid-gestation who were referred to the UCSD Prenatal Center for evaluation of an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test and subsequently identified as carrying a baby with gastroschisis. Nine controls were selected from a false positive AFP or from the UCSD prenatal clinic. Maternal dietary intake was collected via repeated food record during the last 20 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression was used to test the association between dietary intake of linoleic acid and odds of gastroschisis. Dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with increased odds of gastroschisis (OR = 1.72; 95{\%} CI: 1.08, 2.74; P = 0.02). A higher maternal intake of omega-6 PUFAs may increase the risk of having a baby with gastroschisis. The mechanism by which this occurs may be via inflammatory processes and oxidative stress leading to a vascular disruption. More research is needed including studies investigating integrated markers of PUFA status or inflammatory markers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the reasons women experience delays in the diagnosis of endometriosis and the impact of this. Design: A qualitative interview-based study of 32 women, 28 of whom were subsequently diagnosed with endometriosis. Setting: Southeast England. Patient(s): Women attending a pelvic pain clinic. Intervention(s): Semistructured interviews. Main Outcome Measure(s): Women's reported experiences of being diagnosed with endometriosis. Result(s): Delays in the diagnosis of endometriosis occur at an individual patient level and a medical level, as both women and family doctors normalize symptoms, symptoms are suppressed through hormones, and nondiscriminatory investigations are relied upon. Women benefited from a diagnosis, because it provided a language in which to discuss their condition, offered possible management strategies to control symptoms, and provided reassurance that symptoms were not due to cancer. Diagnosis also sanctioned women's access to social support and legitimized absences from social and work obligations. Conclusion(s): Although recent guidelines for the management of chronic pelvic pain suggest that diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered a secondary investigation after the failure of therapeutic interventions, the present study highlights the importance of an early diagnosis for women who suffer at physical, emotional, and social levels when they remain undiagnosed. ?? 2006 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.},

abstract = {Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by mater- nal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterised by growth deficiency, central nervous system damage/dysfunction, and a unique cluster of minor facial anomalies. To assess the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts, one must be able to estimate accurately the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome over time in population-based samples. With the establishment of the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network of clinics, the development of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Facial Photographic Analysis Software, the creation of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the establishment of the Foster Care Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Screening Program, and the collection of Pregnancy Risk Assessment Management System data on maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy, the tools, methods and infrastructure for assessing the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome primary prevention efforts in Washington State are in place. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among children in a foster care population, born between 1993 and 1998, decreased with the documented decrease in prevalence of maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy from 1993 and 1998 in Washington State. The prevalence of maternal drinking during pregnancy in Washington State declined significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) from 1993 to 1998 as did the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among foster children born 1993–98 (P {\textless} 0.03). These observations support the likelihood that fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts in Washington State are working successfully},

screening foster care pop in Washington: prevalence 10-15/1000, 100{\%} sensitivity and 99{\%} specificity in population, near compete sample (98{\%}) of pop screened

"When the analysis focused on both timing and level of alcohol use, the decline in FAS was most strongly and significantly correlated with the decline in prevalence of women reporting the highest-risk drinking pattern"

as maternal drinking decreased, so did FAS in foster care based on year of birth (only 5 kids diagnosed altogether, though? or 10?)

same evaluation tools found that large majority of patients diagnosed with this system had no records documenting a previous diagnosis -- ie had been missed

"All 10 children who screened positive for FAS among the first 600 children enrolled had no documentation of risk of FAS in their medical, school, or psychological records even though the oldest was 11 years old and most had several inches of records."

benefit of direct contact with subjects diagnosed, not just surveillance

"Although there is tremendous merit and value in tracking the prevalence of individuals damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS, an accurate and valid screening tool to achieve this does not currently exist."},

abstract = {Obesity is well characterized as a systemic inflammatory condition, and is also associated with cognitive disruption, suggesting a link between the two. We assessed whether peripheral inflammation in maternal obesity may be transferred to the offspring brain, in particular, the hippocampus, and thereby result in cognitive dysfunction. Rat dams were fed a high-saturated-fat diet (SFD), a high-trans-fat diet (TFD), or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 4 wk prior to mating, and remained on the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. SFD/TFD exposure significantly increased body weight in both dams and pups compared to controls. Microglial activation markers were increased in the hippocampus of SFD/TFD pups at birth. At weaning and in adulthood, proinflammatory cytokine expression was strikingly increased in the periphery and hippocampus following a bacterial challenge [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] in the SFD/TFD groups compared to controls. Microglial activation within the hippocampus was also increased basally in SFD rats, suggesting a chronic priming of the cells. Finally, there were marked changes in anxiety and spatial learning in SFD/TFD groups. These effects were all observed in adulthood, even after the pups were placed on standard chow at weaning, suggesting these outcomes were programmed early in life.},
annote = {obesity = systemic inflammation


question: can peripheral inflammation in maternal obesity be transferred to the offspring brain?

rats with 3 diets for 4 weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation

high saturated fat, high trans fat, low fat

SFD and TFD -{\textgreater} higher weight in moms, birth weight

microglial activation markers increased in hippocampus

microglial activation within hippocampus also increased basally in SFD, suggesting a chronic priming of the cells

marked changes in anxiety and social learning in adulthood despite same diet after weaning

"increased adipose tissue in obese individuals is associated with elevated serum inflammatory markers"

"obesity and insulin resistance are also strongly linked to cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease" (13, 14)

"Neuroinflammation is independently linked to cognitive disruption" 15

does peripheral inflammation in obesity contribute directly to inflammation cytokine production in cognitive regions of the brain --{\textgreater} cognitive disruption?

"We predicted that trans fat would not only enter the brains of offspring [can be transported across the placenta and efficiently transferred via breast milk 19-21] but would activate resident macrophages (microglia), as has been demonstrated for saturated fats on peripheral macrophages (23, 24) with possible long-term consequences for brain function."

leptin concentrations accurate indicator of overall adipose tissue levels

leptin levels increased in pups, even as adults

"We assessed whether gestation by a dam fed an SFD or TFD would increase markers of glial activation... ... as well as cytokines within the hippocampus and cortex of pups at P1 (first day after birth)... There was a significant effect of diet on [microglia marker] and [Toll-like receptor 4 -- they tested the two TLRs on Myeloid dendritic cells] within the hippocampus" no sig difs in cytokines, no sig diffs (through similar trends) in the cortex

IL-1B response to saline or LPS challenge -- higher in SFD rats, then TFD, then LDF: "IL-1B protein is strikingly incresased in the hippocampus of rats born to SFD dams"

"Microglial activation is increased basally in the brains of SFD rats in adulthood, and is more reactive to LPS in both high-fat-diet groups" -- Iba1 protein expression

water maze: "latency was higher in LFD rats than high-fat-diet groups, suggesting improved retention in the high-fat-diet groups" no sig difs in platform crossing, target quadrant time in females at 2 hours, or in either group at 18 hours

theory behind TLRs: "have been referred to as generic "danger" receptors and may, therefore, respond to excess exogenous fats as foreign or harmful. We hypothesized that maternal high-fat diet may activate TLRs present on glia in the offspring brain, with long-term consequences for neural function.... changes may be relatively specific to TLR4 on microglia, consistent with previous studies"

particularly striking that exaggerated immune response (hippocampal IL-1B) remains in adulthood

"we hypothesized that high-fat-diet exposure may prime microglial activation long-term, a phenomenon that has been reported in the context of aging, neurodegeneration, stress, and early life infection (34-37) Our assessment of Iba1 morphology and exaggerated central IL-1B in the SFD rats is consistent with a primed phenotype. However, both male and female SFD rats had increased leptin as adults, which may instead be driving microglial activation within the brain, rather than a change intrinsic to the glia themselves."

multiple reports that high-fat-diet intake impairs cognition in rodents (40-42)

"Fatty acids are critical for brain development and myelination; thus, dietary patterns that change the composition of fatty acids present in the fetal brain may have significant consequences."

"Shifts in the balance of [the fatty acid palmitate] could influence learning and memory (18)"

"inverted-U function for optimal IL-1B and cognition"

"The TFD males swam significantly faster, suggesting they were more motivated to escape. Strong support of this hypothesis is that high-fat-diet rats were more anxious in the elevated plus maze.... These data support a small by growing literature linking obesity to increased anxiety and depression (48-50)"

abstract = {The National Heart Lung Blood Institute Nutrition Data System was examined with regard to sources of variance. A Graeco-Latin square design involving 30 male and 30 female subjects, each interviewed six times, three trained interviewers and three interview days was used. Through factorial analysis of variance it was demonstrated that there was no difference between interviewers and no training effect associated with the sequence of interviews. Conversely, there was a strong sex difference in absolute nutrient intake, and in females, but not males, a strong day of the week effect. Both of these disappeared when nutrient concentrations (in proportion to energy) were examined. In a direct comparison of centrally computed and hand calculated nutrient vectors from 60 recalls, it was found that data handling contributed a small component of variance for most nutrients studied. This variance was larger in the case of the polyunsaturated fatty acids and the P:S ratio. When the ratio of interindividual (true between subject variation in "usual" intake) coefficient of variation over intraindividual (day by day variation in intake, day of the week variation in females, any methodological errors) coefficient of variation was calculated, it was found to be between I and 1.2 for absolute intakes of energy, protein, total carbohydrate, total fat, and monounsaturated fatty acids, and to rise to 1.7 to 2.1 for polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. When the nutrients were expressed in proportion to energy, total variance tended to fall, interindividual variance fell and intraindividual variance was affected to a much lesser degree. The ratio rose sharply. The presence of intraindividual variation will bias estimates of correlation coefficients and of regression slopes toward 0 and will result in missclassification of subjects into ranges of usual dietary intakes. Erroneous interpretations may be placed on negative findings in epidemiological studies. This problem is not eliminated by increasing group size. Knowledge of the partitioning of variance may be of considerable benefit in examining relationships between variables as in diet-lipid-heart disease studies and in the design of future studies.},

Study subjects consist of 3,412 US children aged 60-83 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Mother and Child Survey. Cognitive test scores using the Peabody Individual Achievement Test reading recognition and mathematics tests were used as the outcomes of interest. Association with maternal prepregnancy obesity was examined using the ordinary least square regression controlling for intrauterine, family background, maternal and child factors. Children of obese women had 3 points (0.23 SD units) lower peabody individual achievement test (PIAT) reading recognition score (p = 0.007), and 2 points (0.16 SD units) lower PIAT mathematics scores (p {\textless} 0.0001), holding all other factors constant. As expected, cognitive test score was associated with stimulating home environment (reading: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001), household income (reading: $\beta$ = 0.03, p = 0.02 and math: $\beta$ = 0.04, p = 0.004), maternal education (reading: $\beta$ = 0.42, p = 0.0005, and math: $\beta$ = 0.32, p = 0.008), and maternal cognitive skills (reading: $\beta$ = 0.11, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.09, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was a significant association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores that could not be explained by other intrauterine, family background, maternal, and child factors. Children who live in disadvantaged postnatal environments may be most affected by the effects of maternal prepregnancy obesity. Replications of the current study using different cohorts are warranted to confirm the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Results from studies examining associations of maternal diabetes in pregnancy with offspring cognitive outcomes have been inconclusive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK prospective pregnancy cohort. Outcomes were School Entry Assessment (SEA) scores (age 4, N = 6, 032) and WISC-III IQ (age 8, N = 5, 282-5,307) and General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) results (age 16, N = 7, 615).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Existing diabetes, gestational diabetes, and, to a lesser extent, glycosuria were associated with lower offspring SEA scores (age 4), IQ (age 8), and GCSE results (age 16) even when adjusting for offspring sex, maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, smoking in pregnancy, parity, caesarean section, maternal education, and occupational social class. Offspring of mothers with existing diabetes had a threefold risk of achieving no GCSEs graded A*-C, whilst offspring of women with gestational diabetes had, on average, a five point lower IQ compared to offspring of women with no diabetes or glycosuria.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes in pregnancy is consistently associated with lower offspring cognition and educational attainment though confidence intervals were wide. The weaker associations with glycosuria suggest a dose-dependent adverse association with IQ.},

abstract = {This paper considers total and direct effects in linear structural equation models. Adopting a causal perspective that is implicit in much of the literature on the subject, the paper concludes that in many instances the effects do not admit the interpretations imparted in the literature. Drawing a distinction between concomitants and factors, the paper concludes that a concomitant has neither total nor direct effects on other variables. When a variable is a factor and one or more intervening variables are concomitants, the notion of a direct effect is not causally meaningful. Even when the notion of a direct effect is meaningful, the usual estimate of this quantity may be inappropriate. The total effect is usually interpreted as an equilibrium multiplier. In the case where there are simultaneity relations among the dependent variables in tghe model, the results in the literature for the total effects of dependent variables on other dependent variables are not equilibrium multipliers, and thus, the usual interpretation is incorrect. To remedy some of these deficiencies, a new effect, the total effect of a factorX on an outcomeY, holding a set of variablesF constant, is defined. When defined, the total and direct effects are a special case of this new effect, and the total effect of a dependent variable on a dependent variable is an equilibrium multiplier.},

@article{Goodman1999a,
abstract = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

We divided the items into two main groups: those that  reflect externalizing problems (manifestations of distress that are expressed in outward behavior, such as persisten disobedienceor physical aggression) and thoe that reflect internalizing problems (manifestations of distress that are expressed in inward feelsings, such as depression or moddiness) based on factor analysis of the 1986 items. The items for the two scales are listed in Appendiz Table 2. not all items loaded clearly on one factor of the otehr; the final two scales included a total of 22 itens. The reliabilities are .86 for externalizing problems and .72 for internalizing problems. We used simple summated scales in our analysis."

"Because each of the broad scales encompasses a variety of other specific constellations of problems, we replicated all of our analyses using pre-specified subscales for hyperactive behaviors, headstrong behaviors, antisocial behaviors, anxiety/depression, peer withdrawal, and dependency (as determined by NLSY staff). Those analyses did not provide any information of substance beyond what we report here. In addition, we wondered whether the effects of childhood emotional and behavioral problems might be stronger in the comparison of children with very serious problems than they are along the continuum.We did not have access to diagnostic measures for this type of comparison, but we did run models for dichotomized measures of emotional and behavioral problems to see whether the effects were nonlinear."￼},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a preventable birth defect, easiest to recognize in children two through eleven years and more difficult to recognize in newborns. In New York State, two systems ascertain FAS cases, the statewide birth defects registry and the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network (FASSNet) system. The accuracy of FAS reports to the birth defects registry was assessed through a comparison with the FASSNet system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The birth defects registry mandates reporting up to age two, including FAS with an ICD-9 code of 760.71. FASSNet is a population-based, multi-source surveillance and uses a standard definition to determine FAS case status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among 33 children reported to the registry with FAS, 19 (58{\%}) met FASSNet criteria for FAS. FASSNet identified 24 additional children with FAS facial features documented before the child's second birthday that should have been reported to the birth defects registry. FAS prevalence rate for the birth defects registry was 0.28 per 1,000 live births but would have been 0.37 if all children diagnosed before age two were included.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Almost 60{\%} of children reported to a birth defects registry with FAS from 1995 to 1998 were confirmed as FAS based on a more intensive surveillance. Additional children with FAS were not reported to the CMR. FAS prevalence calculated from birth defects registries, relying on the ICD-9 code 760.71, include false positives and underestimate the true prevalence. Age limits for reporting FAS to registries further contribute to under ascertainment.},

"Many states have active or passive birth defects registries that, if effective, would be useful to estimate FAS trends and monitor prevention efforts nationally. The majority of birth defects registries require reporting before the child's first or second birthday, an appropriate window for most structural, functional, or biochemical abnormalities that registries were originally designed to detect, but an inappropriate window for conditions such as autism, mental retardation, and FAS. Our analysis of the NY CMR suggests that birth defect registries are not effective tools to monitor FAS rates."},

We examined changes over time in maternal characteristics of deliveries and disparities and changes in risks of fetal, first day ({\textless}24 h), and cause-specific deaths. We calculated descriptive statistics, odds ratios and confidence intervals, and ratio of odds ratios (RORs) to indicate changes in disparities. Along with black mothers, AIANs exhibited the highest proportion of risk factors including the highest proportion of diabetes in both time periods (4.6 and 6.5 {\%}). Over time, late fetal death for AIANs decreased 17 {\%} (aOR = 0.83, 95 {\%} CI 0.72-0.97), but we noted a 47 {\%} increased risk over time for Hispanics (aOR = 1.47, 95 {\%} CI 1.40-1.55). Our data indicated no change over time among AIANs for first day death. For AIANs compared to whites, increased risks and disparities persisted for mortality due to congenital anomalies (ROR = 1.28, 95 {\%} CI 1.03-1.60). For blacks compared to AIANs, the increased risks of fetal death (2005-2008: aOR = 0.60, 95 {\%} CI 0.53-0.68) persisted. For Hispanics, lower risks compared to AIANs persisted, but protective effect declined over time. Disparities between AIAN and other groups persist, but there is variability by race/ethnicity in improvement of perinatal outcomes over time. Variability in access to care and pregnancy management should be considered in relation to health equity for fetal and early infant deaths.},

fetal mortality greater for AI than whites, hispanics, but less than blacks

"Despite similar, and it some cases, lower proportions of risk factors for adverse outcomes, blacks had higher rates and risks of mortality, borth fetal and first day, compared to other population groups.However, AIANs had less improvement in outcomes over time for early infant deaths and those early infant deahts associated with congential anamolies."

"Limited improvements in first day deaths related to congenital anaomalies among AIANs could suggest that congenital anoalies among AIANs coudl suggest that congenital anomalies may not be identified prior to delivery and tehrefore cannot be managed properly or that management varies by population group. Also, congenital anomalies that are diagnosed prior to delivery may require culturally appropriate management. AIAN women may make different choices compared ot the overall US population, both in terms of continuation of the pregnancy and differences in access to services if termination is desired may exist."

abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates expression of numerous genes, including those of the CYP1 gene family. With the goal of determining factors that control AHR gene expression, our studies are focused on the role of the short tandem repeat polymorphism, (GGGGC)n, located in the proximal promoter of the human AHR gene. When luciferase constructs containing varying GGGGC repeats were transfected into cancer cell lines derived from the lung, colon, and breast, the number of GGGGC repeats affected AHR promoter activity. The number of GGGGC repeats was determined in DNA from 327 humans and from 38 samples representing 5 species of non-human primates. In chimpanzees and 3 species of macaques, only (GGGGC)2 alleles were observed; however, in western gorilla, (GGGGC)n alleles with n=2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were identified. In all human populations examined, the frequency of (GGGGC)n was n=4{\textgreater}5≫2, 6. When frequencies of the (GGGGC)n alleles in DNA from patients with lung, colon, or breast cancer were evaluated, the occurrence of (GGGGC)2 was found to be 8-fold more frequent among lung cancer patients in comparison with its incidence in the general population, as represented by New York State neonates. Analysis of matched tumor and non-tumor DNA samples from the same individuals provided no evidence of microsatellite instability. These studies indicate that the (GGGGC)n short tandem repeats are inherited, and that the (GGGGC)2 allele in the AHR proximal promoter region should be further investigated with regard to its potential association with lung cancer susceptibility.},

abstract = {Abstract: Recently, a nonparametric marginal structural model (NPMSM) approach to Causal Inference has been proposed [Neugebauer, R., van der Laan, M., 2006. Nonparametric causal effects based on marginal structural models. J. Statist. Plann. Inference (in press), www http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03783758 .] as an appealing practical alternative to the original parametric MSM (PMSM) approach introduced by Robins [Robins, J., 1998a. Marginal structural models. In: 1997 Proceedings of the American Statistical Association, American Statistical Association, Alexandria, VA, pp. 1{\^{a}}€“10]. The new MSM-based causal inference methodology generalizes the concept of causal effects: the proposed nonparametric causal effects are interpreted as summary measures of the causal effects defined with PMSMs. In addition, causal inference with NPMSM does not rely on the assumed correct specification of a parametric MSM but instead defines causal effects based on a user-specified working causal model which can be willingly misspecified. The NPMSM approach was developed for studies with point treatment data or with longitudinal data where the outcome is not time-dependent (typically collected at the end of data collection). In this paper, we generalize this approach to longitudinal studies where the outcome is time-dependent, i.e. collected throughout the span of the studies, and address the subsequent estimation inconsistency which could easily arise from a hasty generalization of the algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. More generally, we provide an overview of the multiple causal effect representations which have been developed based on MSMs in longitudinal studies.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding has been shown to enhance global measures of intelligence in children. However, few studies have examined associations between breastfeeding and specific cognitive task performance in the first 2 y of life, particularly in an Asian population. OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between early infant feeding and detailed measures of cognitive development in the first 2 y of life in healthy Asian children born at term. DESIGN: In a prospective cohort study, neurocognitive testing was performed in 408 healthy children (aged 6, 18, and 24 mo) from uncomplicated pregnancies (i.e., birth weight {\textgreater}2500 and {\textless}4000 g, gestational age ≥37 wk, and 5-min Apgar score ≥9). Tests included memory (deferred imitation, relational binding, habituation) and attention tasks (visual expectation, auditory oddball) as well as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Children were stratified into 3 groups (low, intermediate, and high) on the basis of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. RESULTS: After potential confounding variables were controlled for, significant associations and dose-response relations were observed for 4 of the 15 tests. Higher breastfeeding exposure was associated with better memory at 6 mo, demonstrated by greater preferential looking toward correctly matched items during early portions of a relational memory task (i.e., relational binding task: P-trend = 0.015 and 0.050 for the first two 1000-ms time bins, respectively). No effects of breastfeeding were observed at 18 mo. At 24 mo, breastfed children were more likely to display sequential memory during a deferred imitation memory task (P-trend = 0.048), and toddlers with more exposure to breastfeeding scored higher in receptive language [+0.93 (0.23, 1.63) and +1.08 (0.10, 2.07) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively, compared with the low-breastfeeding group], as well as expressive language [+0.58 (-0.06, 1.23) and +1.22 (0.32, 2.12) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively] assessed via the BSID-III. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest small but significant benefits of breastfeeding for some aspects of memory and language development in the first 2 y of life, with significant improvements in only 4 of 15 indicators. Whether the implicated processes confer developmental advantages is unknown and represents an important area for future research. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.},

In their study in 18-mo-old children, Leventakou et al. (58) reported that breastfeeding duration was positively associated with BSID-III cognitive, receptive, and expressive language. 

 









we also observed associations between breastfeeding duration and higher cognitive scores on the BSID-III. Breastfeeding has been associated with improved motor skills in 3- and 6-mo-old infants (53). However, we did not observe an association with motor scores at 24 mo, which is consistent with work conducted in toddlers (53–55). We did, however, observe associations with expressive and receptive language development, which can also be characterized as requiring relational memory between conceptual meanings and particular sounds or signs during vocabulary acquisition},

Numerical examples demonstrate that the observed results of both conventional and alternative studies are mutually compatible with a broad range of true values of the association under study, and that there is no a priori basis for assuming that either set of results is closer to the true value.

abstract = {Prospective studies that examine marital status differences in health and mortality frequently fail to update information on marital status in statistical models. The authors illustrate how the resulting misclassification of marital status can produce substantial bias in estimates of bereavement effects associated with widowhood. They use as their main source of data the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA), 1984-1990, a national survey of persons aged 70 years and older. The estimates are based primarily on 3,192 respondents who were married and cohabiting with their spouses at the time of the baseline survey and who could be matched to their spouses' records. Comparisons of widowhood status derived from matched spouse records with reported marital status recorded in LSOA interviews demonstrate that reliance on interview information leads to substantial misclassification of marital status. Results from survival models indicate that estimates of marital status effects are sensitive to whether and how marital status is updated after baseline interviews. For example, updating marital status in hazard models from interview information alone indicates a protective effect of widowhood, whereas classifying widowhood on the basis of spouses' death records reveals a significant bereavement effect (relative mortality risks between 1.3 and 1.4).},

abstract = {Ideally, randomized trials would be used to compare the long-term effectiveness of dynamic treatment regimes on clinically relevant outcomes. However, because randomized trials are not always feasible or timely, we often must rely on observational data to compare dynamic treatment regimes. An example of a dynamic treatment regime is "start combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) within 6 months of CD4 cell count first dropping below x cells/mm3 or diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness, whichever happens first" where x can take values between 200 and 500. Recently, Cain et al (2011) used inverse probability (IP) weighting of dynamic marginal structural models to find the x that minimizes 5-year mortality risk under similar dynamic regimes using observational data. Unlike standard methods, IP weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders (e.g., CD4 cell count, viral load) that are affected by prior treatment. Here we describe an alternative method to IP weighting for comparing the effectiveness of dynamic cART regimes: the parametric g-formula. The parametric g-formula naturally handles dynamic regimes and, like IP weighting, can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders. However, estimators based on the parametric g-formula are more efficient than IP weighted estimators. This is often at the expense of more parametric assumptions. Here we describe how to use the parametric g-formula to estimate risk by the end of a user-specified follow-up period under dynamic treatment regimes. We describe an application of this method to answer the "when to start" question using data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

In children and adolescents, the prevalence of overweight has tripled in the last 20 years, with approximately 16.0{\%} of children ages 6-19, and 10.3{\%} of 2-5 year olds being considered overweight. Considerable research is underway to understand obesity in the general pediatric population, however little research is available on the prevalence of obesity in children with developmental disorders. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of overweight among a clinical population of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 140 charts of children ages 3-18 years seen between 1992 and 2003 at a tertiary care clinic that specializes in the evaluation and treatment of children with developmental, behavioral, and cognitive disorders. Diagnostic, medical, and demographic information was extracted from the charts. Primary diagnoses of either ADHD or ASD were recorded, as was information on race/ethnicity, age, gender, height, and weight. Information was also collected on medications that the child was taking. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measures of height and weight recorded in the child's chart. The Center for Disease Control's BMI growth reference was used to determine an age- and gender-specific BMI z-score for the children. RESULTS: The prevalence of at-risk-for-overweight (BMI {\textgreater} 85th{\%}ile) and overweight (BMI {\textgreater} 95th{\%}ile) was 29{\%} and 17.3{\%} respectively in children with ADHD. Although the prevalence appeared highest in the 2-5 year old group (42.9{\%}ile), differences among age groups were not statistically significant. Prevalence did not differ between boys and girls or across age groups (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). For children with ASD, the overall prevalence of at-risk-for-overweight was 35.7{\%} and prevalence of overweight was 19{\%}. CONCLUSION: When compared to an age-matched reference population (NHANES 1999-2002), our estimates indicate that children with ADHD and with ASD have a prevalence of overweight that is similar to children in the general population.},

abstract = {Theoretical considerations concerning the use of other cancer patients as controls in cancer case-control studies are reviewed. Selection bias may be a problem in that some other cancers may be caused by the exposure under study biasing the odds ratio towards unity. Such bias is noted to be greatest with low prevalence exposures associated with high attributable risks for other cancers. However, it may be possible to identify selection bias with other cancer controls using census or other general population data. In addition, using other cancers as controls has important advantages with regard to recall and interviewer bias, which may be of unknown magnitude and direction when using general population controls. A further disadvantage of general population controls is that separate selection of decreased controls should usually be made for deceased cases, whereas a mixture of live and deceased controls can be expected when selecting other cancer patients as controls. Since there are also logistical and cost advantages in using other cancer patients as controls, this study design is likely to be used increasingly in the future, particularly in cancer registry settings.},

abstract = {Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants that cause multiple adverse health effects in humans, mainly through binding to the ligand-activated transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Genetic variation in AhR may modulate the susceptibility to dioxins. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -130 C/T in the AhR promoter on dioxin-inducible gene transcription, and to investigate interleukin-24 (IL-24) and interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) as proxies for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure. Using primary human chorionic stromal cells, we found that cells with the TT genotype showed higher AhR mRNA and protein levels than did those of the CC genotype. Microarray was carried out to analyze the gene expression profiles of cells (CC and TT genotype) after exposing the cells to TCDD. Several genes associated with human disorders were more highly up-regulated in cells of the TT genotype. Higher up-regulation of IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$ mRNA in cells with the TT genotype was observed. Furthermore, blood samples from 64 Yusho patients who were accidentally exposed to high concentrations of dioxins were analyzed for the genotype, dioxins concentrations and serum levels of IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$. We observed higher serum IL-24 levels and lower serum IL-1$\beta$ levels in Yusho patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype. AhR SNP -130 C/T affects serum IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$ levels, independently of serum dioxins concentrations in Yusho patients. Our observations demonstrate that SNP -130 C/T modulates AhR expression and expression levels of IL-24 and IL-1$\beta$, and suggest an association of AhR SNP -130 C/T with the susceptibility to dioxins.},

"ACEs have been related to increased propensity for substance use... antisocial behavior..."
"exposure to multiple stressors in childhood is also associated with subsequent unintended pregnancies (14), and being a victim or perpetrator of violence, including intimate partner violence (15). Together, these sexual and violent behaviors create a mechanism for intergenerational passage of ACEs and their health consequences."
"However, there is currently little understanding of the potential impact of reducing ACEs independent of socioeconomic factors (for example, deprivation) that are also associated with poor health choices and anti-social behavior."
categorized as 0 ACEs, 1 ACE, 2-3 ACEs, 4+ ACEs
"for each HHB, model parameters for age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation were applied to national and sample populations with ACE count parameters set to the observed values, and then with ACE count parameters set to zero ACEs"
adjusted to population
"For all ACEs, Asian ethnicity had the lowest prevalence for each ACE except living with a household member with mental illness or alcohol abuse"
"After using LR (logistic regression) models to account for the confounding effects of deprivation and other demographics, odds of all HHBs except low physical exercise were significantly higher in those with 4+ or 3 to 3 ACEs (versus none). Having one ACE (versus none) was associated with a significant increase in unintended teenage pregnancy, early sexual initiation, binge drinking, cannabis use, violence perpetration, violence victimization, and incarceration."
"For each HHB, the best-fit LR models were used to calculate expected HHB prevalence in the sample and national population if no ACEs were experienced. Although causality could not be established in this study, modeling estimated that nationally 13.6{\%} of poor diet and up to 58.7{\%} of heroin or crack cocaine use is related to ACEs. ACEs also accounted for approximately half of all individuals experiencing violence in the past year, either as a perpetrator or a victim."
"Moreover, we found that ACEs accounted for around a third of individuals reporting early sexual initiation and unintended teen pregnancy. Such pregnancies can mean that individuals are born into settings typically less prepared for the needs of children, with fewer resources for child-rearing, poorer parenting skills, and consequently greater opportunity for child abuse (25), again ensuring intergenerational transmission of ACEs and related harms."},

abstract = {The relationship between smoking and melanoma remains unclear. Among the different results is the paradoxical finding that smoking was shown to be inversely associated with the risk of malignant melanoma in some large cohort and case-control studies, even after control for suspected confounding variables. Smoking is a known risk factor for many non-communicable diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, as well as other malignancies; it has been shown to be positively associated with other types of skin cancer, and there remains no clear biologic explanation for a possible protective effect on malignant melanoma. In this paper, we propose a plausible mechanism of bias from smoking-related competing risks that may explain or contribute to the inverse association between smoking and melanoma as spurious. Using directed acyclic graphs for formalization and visualization of assumptions, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we demonstrate how published inverse associations might be compatible with selection bias resulting from uncontrolled or unmeasured common causes of competing outcomes of smoking-related diseases and malignant melanoma. We present results from various scenarios assuming a true null as well as a true positive association between smoking and malignant melanoma. Under a true null assumption, we find inverse associations due to the biasing mechanism to be compatible with published results in the literature, especially after the addition of unmeasured confounding variables. This study could be seen as offering a cautionary note in the interpretation of published smoking-melanoma findings.},

Simple causal diagrams and 2 × 2 tables illustrate how Berkson's bias connects to collider bias and selection bias more generally, and show the strong analogies between Berksonian selection bias and bias due to missing data. In some situations, considerations of whether data are missing at random or missing not at random are less important than the causal structure of the missing data process. Although dealing with missing data always relies on strong assumptions about unobserved variables, the intuitions built with simple examples can provide a better understanding of approaches to missing data in real-world situations.},

Perinatal mortality rate was 6.3{\%}. The follow-up study was conducted when the children were approximately 5 years of age and included a physical and a neurological evaluation, IQ determination of mother and child, and an interview of mother by a psychologist. Fifty-three infants of insulin-dependent (IDM) and 20 infants of gestational diabetic mothers (IGDM) (83{\%}) participated, 3 families could not be traced and 12 were unwilling. The group lost to follow-up (13 IDM, 2 IGDM) had more perinatal complications including congenital malformations than the follow-up group. All children had normal physical and neurological development. IQ was normal, the majority were above 100, the average in IDM was 115 (range 98-144) and 112 in IGDM (range 95-133). No obvious relationship was found between maternal acetonuria during pregnancy, infant birthweight, blood glucose during first hours after birth or neonatal complications and IQ of the children. A correlation (r = 0.364, p less than 0.01) was found between maternal and child IQ.

abstract = {Study Objectives: We sought to determine whether selected periconceptional health behaviors that influence risk for birth defects differ between older and younger adolescents and whether pregnancy intention predicts more positive preconception health behaviors among teens. Design and Participants: We analyzed interview responses from 954 adolescent control group participants from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study who delivered live infants during 1997-2007. Main Outcome Measures: Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for factors of interest by age categories (13-15, 16-17, and 18 years, relative to 19 years). To construct a composite periconceptional behavior index, we summed the following healthy behaviors: nonsmoker, nondrinker, folic acid supplementation, and eating 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Results: Analyses indicated that women in the youngest group (13-15 years of age) were more likely to be Hispanic (aOR 2.83, 95{\%} CI 1.40-5.70) and less likely to engage in some unhealthy pregnancy-related behaviors compared with 19-year-olds, such as smoking (aOR 0.45, 95{\%} CI 0.20-0.99) and being overweight or obese (aOR 0.32, 95{\%} CI 0.16-0.61). However, they were also less likely to have taken periconceptional folic acid (aOR 0.44, 95{\%} CI 0.21-0.90). About one-third of teen mothers indicated that their pregnancies had been intended. Among 18- and 19-year-olds, this predicted a higher mean value for the composite periconceptional behavior index (2.30 versus 1.94, P ≤ .01). Conclusions: Teen mothers are not a homogeneous group. Each age subgroup presents varied demographic and behavioral factors that put them at varying levels of risk for birth defects. Furthermore, caregivers should not assume that teens do not plan pregnancies or that they need not be informed of the importance of periconceptional health.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in energy expenditure and body composition in relationship to alterations in carbohydrate metabolism in women with normal and abnormal glucose metabolism. We hypothesized that women with decreased insulin sensitivity before conception would have less fat accretion and smaller increases in energy expenditure. STUDY DESIGN: Six women with normal glucose tolerance and 10 women with abnormal glucose tolerance were evaluated before conception, and in early (12 to 14 weeks) and late (34 to 36 weeks) gestation. Body composition was estimated by hydrodensitometry, resting energy expenditure, and glucose and fat metabolism by indirect calorimetry, endogenous glucose production by infusion of [6-6 2H2] glucose, and insulin sensitivity using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m2/min). RESULTS: There was a smaller increase in fat mass (1.3 kg [P = .04]) in early pregnancy in women with abnormal glucose tolerance before pregnancy. Indirect calorimetry measured gestational age-related increases in basal oxygen utilization, with or without correction for fat-free mass (VO2, P = .002), resting energy expenditure (expressed in kilocalories, P = .0001), and carbohydrate oxidation (P = .0003). The insulin-mediated elevation in VO2 increased in later gestation VO2 (P = .005), as did resting energy expenditure (P = .0001) and fat oxidation (P = 0.0001). However, there was a decrease in respiratory quotient (P = .0001), carbohydrate oxidation (P = .002), and nonoxidative carbohydrate metabolism (P = .0001) with advancing gestation during insulin infusion. In early pregnancy, changes in fat mass correlated inversely with changes in insulin sensitivity (r= -0.52, P = .04) and changes in basal VO2 correlated inversely with decreases in basal endogenous glucose production (r = -0.74, P = .01). CONCLUSION: In early gestation, the changes in maternal fat mass and basal oxygen consumption are inversely related to the changes in insulin sensitivity. This response in lean women with decreased insulin sensitivity before conception may have survival value by providing a larger amount of available substrate to meet fetoplacental needs during gestation.},

Various studies in developed countries have linked a wide range of seasonal factors to lower birthweights.14-18 Difference in latitude has been offered as an explanation for such discrepancy, and a vitamin D hy- pothesis followed as a consequence.6,18 

POBW Proportion of optimal birthweight, developed by Blair, et al







In multivariate models adjustment was made for maternal condition/complica- tion (gestational and preexisting diabetes, preeclampsia, indigenous status, mar- ried/de facto relationship status, and smoking during pregnancy). 







A summer third trimester was associated with a significant decrease in POBW of 0.18{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.00 – 0.36{\%}) relative to a winter third trimester (Table 4). Effect sizes were rel- atively smaller for other periods and no statistically significant effects were ob- served using the classification of SGA. In summary we observed lower fetal growth for pregnancies with third trimesters predominantly in summer, 











Effect sizes observed for sunlight expo- sure were small and statistically nonsig- nificant. Relatively larger effect sizes and statistical significance were limited to







ambient maximum daily temperature exposure. An IQR increase in tempera- ture over whole pregnancy (0.73°C) was associated with an odds ratio of 1.02 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.00 – 1.05) for SGA. POBW decreased by







0.14{\%} (0.01-0.27{\%}) for an IQR increase (9.15°C) in third-trimester temperature (Table 5). 

In first trimester, an IQR increase in temperature (9.28°C) was associated with an increase in POBW of 0.13{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.00–0.26{\%}). However, as temperature in first trimester was nega- tively very highly correlated with tem- perature in third trimester (r ? – 0.97), we conducted a post hoc analysis using an extra sum of squares F test. This fur- ther analysis indicated that third-trimes- ter temperature explained a significant amount of variation in POBW beyond that explained by first-trimester temper- ature (P ? .0446). However, the con- verse did not apply: first-trimester tem- perature did not explain a significant amount of variation beyond that ex- plained by third-trimester temperature (P =.1317). Therefore, it is likely that the effect observed in first trimester is an"inverse" prozy for that observed in third trimester.










A more detailed evaluation of temperature and sunlight exposure revealed that fetal growth may be adversely affected by higher tempera- tures sustained over pregnancy and were associated with a 2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0–5{\%}) increase in risk of growth restriction (as defined using SGA classification). There was also indication that elevated temper- atures in third trimester predicted de- clines in fetal growth, with a decrease in POBW of 0.14{\%} (0.01-0.27{\%}) per quar- tile increase in temperature (9.15°C). These results suggest that heat effects throughout and potentially late in preg- nancy may constrain fetal growth inde- pendently of ambient air pollutants and other risk factors,},

abstract = {We have argued that the concept of attributable fraction requires separation into the concepts of excess fraction, etiologic fraction, and incidence-density fraction. These quantities do not necessarily approximate one another, and the etiologic fraction is not generally estimable without strong biologic assumptions. For these reasons, care is needed in deciding which (if any) of the concepts is appropriate for a particular application. It appears that the excess fraction (like incidence proportion) will be most relevant in situations that require only consideration of whether disease occurs by a particular time. In situations that require consideration of when disease occurs, direct measures of effect on incidence time may be as relevant as or more relevant than any attributable fraction. To avoid technical complications, we have not discussed additional problems of causal attribution that can arise when exposure has multiple levels or is sustained over time, and the estimation problems that can arise when considering case-control studies, competing risks, or differential censoring. For more detailed discussions of such problems and proposed solutions, see references 11-20.},

abstract = {Although measures of the home environment have gained wide acceptance in the child development literature, what constitutes the "average" or 'typical" home environment in the United States, and how this differs across ethnic groups and poverty status is not known. Item-level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on four age-related versions of the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form (HOME-SF) from five biennial assessments (1986-1994) were analyzed for the total sample and for four major ethnic groups: European Americans, Asian Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. The percentages of homes receiving credit on each item of all four versions of the HOME-SF are described. For the majority of items at all four age levels differences between poor and nonpoor families were noted. Differences were also obtained among African American, European American, and Hispanic American families, but the magnitude of the effect for poverty status was greater than for ethnicity, and usually absorbed most of the ethnic group effects on HOME-SF items. For every item at every age, the effects of poverty were proportional across European American, African American, and Hispanic American groups.},
annote = {NLSY 1986-1994
"The consequences of any experience that children from a particular ethnic group have in their own home environments depends on the history of intergroup relations in that group's current societal context and the gress of connectedness between family life and other societal institutions designed to support child well-being."
"Thus, there is reason to suspect that certain aspects of the home environment may be less strongly associated with child behavior and development in older children"
"estimates of the heritability of many characteristics increase with age, suggestive of more active selection of environments deemed desirable by children as they grow older."
"Relatedly, Scarr (1992) and others (eg Rowe, Jacobson, Van den Oord 1999) have arged that environmental influences are greatest in conditions that pose a risk or hazard for development."
"Rowe and colleagues (1999) recently found that environmental conditions shared by members of the same family had greater influence in families in which mothers had low educational attainment as compared with families in which mothers had high educational attainment."
HOME
BPI
"The HLM analyses revealed a complicated set of relations between HOME-SF scores and children's behavior problems"
"Overall, fewer behavior problems were observed among children from families with more positive HOME-SF Scale scores, especially when children were older. The patter of association varied as a function of both ethnicity and poverty status, however."
"Pairwise comparisons indicated that associations between learning stimulation and the BPI were stronger among European American children... than among African American children"
"The fact that learning stimulation in this study was associated with children's behavior problems in every ethnic group from early childhood through adolescence, despite controlling for family demographics, parental responsiveness, and the level of spanking, suggests that theories about the causes and maintenance of behavior problems may need to be expanded to consider the roles played by the object environment and direct efforts of parents to provide learning opportunities for their children."
"Other researchers have also observed that the relation between harsh parenting and behavior problems increases with age (Pettit et al., 1997)"},

abstract = {The current statistics associated with breast cancer continue to show a relatively high recurrence rate together with a poor survival for aggressive metastatic disease. These findings reflect, in part, the pharmaceutical intractability of processes involved in the metastatic process and highlight the need to identify additional drug targets for the treatment of late-stage disease. In the current study, we report that ligand activation of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) inhibits multiple aspects of the metastatic process in a panel of breast cancer cell lines that represent the major breast cancer subtypes. Specifically, it was observed that treatment with exogenous AhR agonists significantly inhibited cell invasiveness and motility in the Boyden chamber assay and inhibited colony formation in soft agar regardless of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Knockdown of the AhR using small interfering RNA duplexes demonstrated that the inhibition of invasiveness was receptor dependent and that endogenous receptor activity was protective in each cell type examined. The inhibition of invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth correlated with the ability of exogenous AhR agonists to promote differentiation. Finally, exogenous AhR agonists were able to promote differentiation in a putative mammary cancer stem cell line. Cumulatively, these results suggest that the AhR plays an important role in mammary epithelial differentiation and, as such, represent a promising therapeutic target for a range of phenotypically distinct human breast cancers.},

abstract = {The current study expands upon the extant literature by examining the influence of contextual risk factors (e.g., parental psychological distress, household income, educational attainment) on parental responses to children's emotional experiences. Participants included 97 ethnically and demographically diverse mother-child dyads with children ranging in age from 7 to 12. Mothers reported indicators of supportive and unsupportive emotion socialization practices, and measures of child emotion regulation and emotion dysregulation. Higher scores on the familial risk index were positively related to increased emotion dysregulation and negatively related to decreased emotion regulation through mediated effects of mothers' unsupportive reactions to children's negative emotional expressions. These findings suggest the importance of considering contextual influences on the emotion socialization process and offer potential avenues to foster adaptive emotional development in the context of high risk.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: One in three pregnant women in the United States is obese. Their offspring are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental and metabolic morbidity. Underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We performed a global gene expression analysis of mid-trimester amniotic fluid cell-free fetal RNA in obese versus lean pregnant women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This prospective pilot study included eight obese (BMI≥30) and eight lean (BMI{\textless}25) women undergoing clinically indicated mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis. Subjects were matched for gestational age and fetal sex. Fetuses with abnormal karyotype or structural anomalies were excluded. Cell-free fetal RNA was extracted from amniotic fluid and hybridized to whole genome expression arrays. Genes significantly differentially regulated in 8/8 obese-lean pairs were identified using paired t-tests with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (false discovery rate of {\textless}0.05). Biological interpretation was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the BioGPS gene expression atlas.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In fetuses of obese pregnant women, 205 genes were significantly differentially regulated. Apolipoprotein D, a gene highly expressed in the central nervous system and integral to lipid regulation, was the most up-regulated gene (9-fold). Apoptotic cell death was significantly down-regulated, particularly within nervous system pathways involving the cerebral cortex. Activation of the transcriptional regulators estrogen receptor, FOS, and STAT3 was predicted in fetuses of obese women, suggesting a pro-estrogenic, pro-inflammatory milieu.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Maternal obesity affects fetal neurodevelopmental and metabolic gene expression as early as the second trimester. These findings may have implications for postnatal neurodevelopmental and metabolic abnormalities described in the offspring of obese women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple identical sets of sera from cancer cases and controls would facilitate standardized testing of biomarkers. We describe the creation and use of standard serum sets developed from healthy donors and pooled sera from ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer cases. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-five 0.3-mL aliquots of sera were created for each of the 95 healthy women, and residual serum was pooled to create 275 identical sets of 20 0.3-mL aliquots. Aliquots (1.0-1.5 mL) from 441 women were combined to create 12 breast and pelvic disease pools with at least 115 0.3-mL aliquots. Sets were assembled to contain aliquots from individual controls, replicates, and disease pools. Cancer antigens (CA), CA 125, CA 19.9, and CA 15.3, and carcinoembryonic antigen were measured in one set and in 217 women comprising six of the pelvic disease pools. Use of a set was illustrated for mesothelin (soluble mesothelin-related protein). Statistical output included concentration differences between pooled cases and controls (z values for single analytes; Mahalanobis distances for pairs), correlation between z values and sensitivities, coefficient of variations, and standardized biases. RESULTS: Marker concentrations in the six pelvic disease pools were generally within 0.25 SD of the actual average, and z values correlated well with sensitivities. CA 125 remains the best single marker for nonmucinous ovarian cancer, complemented by CA 15.3 or soluble mesothelin-related protein. There is no comparable breast cancer biomarker among the current analytes tested. CONCLUSION: The potential value of standard serum sets for initial assessment of candidate biomarkers is illustrated. Sets are now available through the Early Detection Research Network to evaluate biomarkers for women's cancers.},

abstract = {We describe how ordinary interpretations of causal models and causal graphs fail to capture important distinctions among ignorable allocation mechanisms for subject selection or allocation. We illustrate these limitations in the case of random confounding and designs that prevent such confounding. In many experimental designs individual treatment allocations are dependent, and explicit population models are needed to show this dependency. In particular, certain designs impose unfaithful covariate-treatment distributions to prevent random confounding, yet ordinary causal graphs cannot discriminate between these unconfounded designs and confounded studies. Causal models for populations are better suited for displaying these phenomena than are individual-level models, because they allow representation of allocation dependencies as well as outcome dependencies across individuals. Nonetheless, even with this extension, ordinary graphical models still fail to capture distinctions between hypothetical superpopulations (sampling distributions) and observed populations (actual distributions), although potential-outcome models can be adapted to show these distinctions and their consequences.},

Estimation of the parameters of a marginal structural model is also available. The package allows outcome data with missingness, and experimental units that contribute repeated records of the point-treatment data structure, thereby allowing the analysis of longitudinal data structures. Relevant factors of the likelihood may be modeled or fit data-adaptively according to user specifications, or passed in from an external estimation procedure.

abstract = {Healthy worker survivor bias may occur in occupational studies due to the tendency for unhealthy individuals to leave work earlier, and consequently accrue less exposure, compared with their healthier counterparts. If occupational data are not analyzed using appropriate methods, this bias can result in attenuation or even reversal of the estimated effects of exposures on health outcomes. Recent advances in computing power, coupled with state-of-the-art statistical methods, have greatly increased the ability of analysts to control healthy worker survivor bias. However, these methods have not been widely adopted by occupational epidemiologists. We update the seminal review by Arrighi and Hertz-Picciotto (Epidemiology.1994; 5: 186-196) of the sources and methods to control healthy worker survivor bias. In our update, we discuss methodologic advances since the publication of that review, notably with a consideration of how directed acyclic graphs can inform the choice of appropriate analytic methods. We summarize and discuss methods for addressing this bias, including recent work applying g-methods to account for employment status as a time-varying covariate affected by prior exposure. In the presence of healthy worker survivor bias, g-methods have advantages for estimating less biased parameters that have direct policy implications and are clearly communicated to decision-makers.},

abstract = {Recent work has considerably advanced the definition, identification and estimation of controlled direct, and natural direct and indirect effects in causal mediation analysis. Despite the various estimation methods and statistical routines being developed, a unified approach for effect estimation under different effect decomposition scenarios is still needed for epidemiologic research. G-computation offers such unification and has been used for total effect and joint controlled direct effect estimation settings, involving different types of exposure and outcome variables. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of parametric g-computation in estimating various components of the total effect, including (1) natural direct and indirect effects, (2) standard and stochastic controlled direct effects, and (3) reference and mediated interaction effects, using Monte Carlo simulations in standard statistical software. For each study subject, we estimated their nested potential outcomes corresponding to the (mediated) effects of an intervention on the exposure wherein the mediator was allowed to attain the value it would have under a possible counterfactual exposure intervention, under a pre-specified distribution of the mediator independent of any causes, or under a fixed controlled value. A final regression of the potential outcome on the exposure intervention variable was used to compute point estimates and bootstrap was used to obtain confidence intervals. Through contrasting different potential outcomes, this analytical framework provides an intuitive way of estimating effects under the recently introduced 3- and 4-way effect decomposition. This framework can be extended to complex multivariable and longitudinal mediation settings.},

Medicine describes how treatments are ineffective when researchers, policy makers, and health professionals do not use a tribal-specific approach to addiction. She offers an indigenous perspective and understanding that should lead to improved approaches to treatment in mental health and alcohol abuse.

abstract = {This paper assesses the seasonal variations of the time and financial costs of illness for rural households in Burkina Faso. It is based on a multiple round survey of 566 households, which included a time allocation study. The economic parameters of households which influence health seeking behavior changed substantially between the dry and rainy seasons: revenues fell in the rainy season and were exceeded by expenditures. Household production was at its peak in the rainy season resulting in significantly higher opportunity costs of time. At the same time illness perception changed: in the rainy season, significantly fewer illness episodes were perceived, and of those, the proportion perceived as severe decreased over-proportionally. Households shifted their healer choice in the rainy season away from high cost treatment, such as the hospital and dispensary, to low cost home treatment. For all these reasons, households incurred significantly fewer costs of illness in the rainy season (27{\%} of dry season costs). Household health care expenditures were reduced to 1/6 of dry season levels, the time costs incurred by healthy household members to tend to the sick was reduced to 1/5 and the time costs of work incapacity due to sickness fell to about 1/2 of dry season levels. The authors stress the need to carry out research in all relevant seasons when studying health seeking behavior and the household costs of illness in order to avoid serious seasonal bias. They suggest policy options to increase health care utilization in the rainy season by reducing the financial and time costs of access to health care. Finally, the authors put forward a hypothesis to be tested by future research: They argue that the cognitive (changes in illness perception) and behavioral changes (different health care seeking) reflect the high opportunity costs of time and the low availability of cash households face during the rainy season. The paper discusses the negative implication that untreated illness has on the health status of household members.},

Obesity was classified as obese I (30.0-34.9), obese II (35.0-39.9), and obese III (≥40.0). Logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence interval, representing the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and each of the 26 specific birth defects (and an 'any birth defect' composite). Models were adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, marital status, and nativity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The livebirth prevalence of any birth defect increased with increasing BMI, from 3.9{\%} among underweight women to 5.3{\%} among obese III women (P {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evidence for the adverse effects of prepregnancy obesity on offspring's neurodevelopmental outcomes has begun to emerge. The authors examined the association between prepregnancy obesity and children's behavioral problems and if the association would differ by race. METHODS: This observational study used a total of 3395 white (n = 2127) and African-American (n = 1268) children aged 96 to 119 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Behavior Problem Index (BPI) total and subscale scores were used to measure children's behavioral problems. The association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and the BPI scores for each racial group was examined using multivariate linear and logistic regressions, controlling for prenatal, child, maternal, and family background factors. RESULTS: Maternal prepregnancy obesity was independently associated with an increase in the BPI total scores among the white sample only. Among the African-Americans, prepregnancy obesity was not associated with the BPI scores. Subsample analyses using externalizing and internalizing subscales also revealed similar trends. Among the white sample, children born to obese women were more socially disadvantaged than those born to nonobese women, whereas no such trend was observed in children of African-American obese and nonobese women. CONCLUSION: The impact of maternal prepregnancy obesity on children's behavioral problems differed by racial groups. Obesity-related metabolic dysregulations during the intrauterine period may not contribute to later children's behavioral problems. Social and psychological factors seem to play key roles in the association between prepregnancy obesity and childhood behavioral problems among whites.},

"On the other hand, among African American childre, prepregnancy obesity was not only a non-significant factor for the BPI total scores but also the direction of the coefficient was opposite from that of Whites. Neither maternal prepregnancy overweight nor underweight was associated with children's BPI total scores. Interestingly, only the coefficient for maternal prepregnancy underweight bore a positive sign."

"contemporaneous maternal obesity was not an independent factor for children's BPI scores in either racial group, suggesting that the timing for a White woman's being obese may play an important role in the association."

"Replication of the study using African American children form a different cohort is warranted to verify our findings."

abstract = {American Indians living in Michigan experience disproportionately high rates of infant mortality. This 11-year (1998-2008) cohort study evaluated impacts of a Healthy Start (HS) program administered by the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan (ITCM) on perinatal outcomes. Women who enrolled in ITCM's HS program ("exposed") were compared with non-enrolled ("unexposed") for four outcomes: low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age, preterm birth, and inadequate prenatal care. To classify exposed and unexposed women and their children, Michigan vital records data were linked with HS enrollment records to identify participants and non-participants among all American Indian births. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for the four outcomes of interest. Analyses were stratified for high and low access to care based on Medically Underserved Area (MUA) designation for a woman's county of residence. Of 4,149 American Indian births during the period, 872 were to women who enrolled prenatally in HS. Although unstratified analysis showed no differences between HS participants and non-participants, stratified analyses demonstrated that participants from MUA counties had decreased odds of LBW and inadequate prenatal care. Results suggest that in MUA counties where participants and non-participants are at similar risk for poor outcomes, HS may be reducing barriers and improving outcomes. In non-MUA counties participants had similar outcomes as non-participants. These results may reflect a wider disparity in risk factors between the two groups in non-MUA counties. The complex interplay among need, access, and benefit complicates analyses and suggests the importance of more in-depth and focused studies.},

abstract = {Bias due to selective mortality is a potential concern in many studies and is especially relevant in cognitive aging research because cognitive impairment strongly predicts subsequent mortality. Biased estimation of the effect of an exposure on rate of cognitive decline can occur when mortality is a common effect of exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline and in similar settings. This potential is often represented as collider-stratification bias in directed acyclic graphs, but it is difficult to anticipate the magnitude of bias. In this paper, we present a flexible simulation platform with which to quantify the expected bias in longitudinal studies of determinants of cognitive decline. We evaluated potential survival bias in naive analyses under several selective survival scenarios, assuming that exposure had no effect on cognitive decline for anyone in the population. Compared with the situation with no collider bias, the magnitude of bias was higher when exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline interacted on the hazard ratio scale to influence mortality or when both exposure and rate of cognitive decline influenced mortality. Bias was, as expected, larger in high-mortality situations. This simulation platform provides a flexible tool for evaluating biases in studies with high mortality, as is common in cognitive aging research.},

Chrysotile asbestos exposure was measured in fiber-years per milliliter of air, and annual occupational exposures were estimated on the basis of detailed work histories. Sixteen percent of person-years involved exposure to asbestos, with a median exposure of 3.30 fiber-years/mL among those exposed. Lung cancer mortality by age 90 years under the observed asbestos exposure was 9.44{\%}. In comparison with observed asbestos exposure, if the facility had operated under the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration asbestos exposure standard of {\textless}0.1 fibers/mL, we estimate that the cohort would have experienced 24{\%} less lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.76, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.62, 0.94). A further reduction in asbestos exposure to a standard of {\textless}0.05 fibers/mL was estimated to have resulted in a minimal additional reduction in lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.75, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.61, 0.92).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests exposure to adverse conditions in intrauterine life may increase the risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood. High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) has been shown to predict child ADHD symptoms, however the neurocognitive processes underlying this relationship are not known. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that this association is mediated by alterations in child executive function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A population-based cohort of 174 children (mean age = 7.3 ± 0.9 (SD) yrs, 55{\%} girls) was evaluated for ADHD symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist, and for neurocognitive function using the Go/No-go task. This cohort had been followed prospectively from early gestation and birth through infancy and childhood with serial measures of maternal and child prenatal and postnatal factors. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was a significant predictor of child ADHD symptoms (F((1,158)) = 4.80, p = 0.03) and of child performance on the Go/No-go task (F((1,157)) = 8.37, p = 0.004) after controlling for key potential confounding variables. A test of the mediation model revealed that the association between higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and child ADHD symptoms was mediated by impaired executive function (inefficient/less attentive processing; Sobel Test: t = 2.39 (± 0.002, SEM), p = 0.02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI-related alterations in child neurocognitive function may mediate its effects on ADHD risk. The finding is clinically significant and may extrapolate to an approximately 2.8-fold increase in the prevalence of ADHD among children of obese compared to those of non-obese mothers. These results add further evidence to the growing awareness that neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD may have their foundations very early in life.},

"It has been suggested that an increased inflammatory milieu during gestation represents a biological condition that may be common across and underlie the effects of these disparate risk factors (15). It is well-established that a fetus developing in an inflammatory milieu is significantly more susceptible to subsequently developing various neruodevelopmental disorders (16, 17, 18)"

maternal obesity: inattention and hyperactivity (8, 22); some but not all studies -- ADHD symptoms in offspring (23, 24, 25)

"child ADHD symptoms have been assessed using subjective teacher and/or parent ratings, and that child neurocognitive deficits that accompany behavioral excesses have not been examined in this context."

"while maternal undernutrition could have an impact on the developing drain by, for example, insufficient supply of methyl donors (48) or of critical nutrients like choline (49) that are necessary for normal brain development, the pathways by which maternal obesity and overnutrition affect the developing brain are believed to be related to obesity-associated metabolic and inflammatory alterations."

"Post-hoc tests revealed that chidren of obese mothers has significantly greater symptom severity than children of normal weight or overweight mothers."

"Maternal gestational weight gain was not significantly associated with child ADHD symptoms"

"Children of obese mothers had higher scores for the measure of inverse efficiency, indicating less efficient processing than children born to normal weight and overweight mothers. Children of overweight mothers did not differ in performance on this task from offspring of normal weight mothers."

mediation: "the association between pre-pregnancy BMi and severity of child ADHD symptoms was significantly reduced when the measure of performance efficiency in the executive function task was included in the model"

abstract = {We sought to identify age group specific maternal risk factors for gastroschisis. Maternal characteristics and prenatal factors were compared for 1,279 live born infants with gastroschisis and 3,069,678 without. Data were obtained using the California database containing linked hospital discharge, birth certificate and death records from 1 year prior to the birth to 1 year after the birth. Backwards-stepwise logistic regression models were used with maternal factors where initial inclusion was determined by a threshold of p {\textless} 0.10 on initial crude analyses. Due to the strong association of gastroschisis with young maternal age, models were stratified by age groups and odds ratios were calculated. These final models identified maternal infection as the only risk factor common to all age groups and a protective effect of obesity and gestational hypertension. In addition, age specific risk factors were identified. Although gestation at the time of infection was not available, a sexually transmitted disease complicating pregnancy was associated with increased risk in the less than 20 years of age grouping whereas viral infection was associated with increased risk only in the 20–24 and more than 24 years of age groupings. Urinary tract infection remained in the final logistic model for women less than 20 years. Short interpregnancy interval was not found to be a risk factor for any age group. Our findings support the need to explore maternal infection by type and gestational timing. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This permits the assessment of a more natural type of direct and indirect effects, one that is applicable in both linear and nonlinear models and that has broader policy-related interpretations.

abstract = {Gastroschisis is a congenital defect of the abdominal wall that occurs most commonly in the offspring of young women. The defect is often hypothesized to result from vascular disruption in the early embryo. We measured the associations between maternal vasoactive exposures in pregnancy, as possible markers of vascular disruption, and gastroschisis risk, using data collected as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. Study participants included mothers of births from October 1997 to December 2003 in 10 states. The mothers of 514 gastroschisis cases were matched by age at delivery and state to 3,277 non-malformed controls and compared for periconceptional smoking and use of vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and vasodilators. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from conditional logistic regression. Case mothers were more likely than control mothers to smoke (OR = 1.5, 95{\%} CI = 1.2-1.9) and report use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (1.4, 1.1-1.7) and anti-hypertensive vasodilators (2.6, 0.9-8.0), but not vasoconstrictive decongestants (1.0, 0.7-1.4). Cigarette smoking had little effect on gastroschisis risk in mothers {\textless}25 years of age, but the OR was 3.0 (1.8-5.0) for those {\textgreater}or=25 years. Likewise, ORs were greatest in the older women for use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (1.6, 1.0-2.6) and bronchodilators (3.0, 1.8-5.0). These findings suggest that, overall, vasoactive risk factors play a minor role in the etiology of gastroschisis, and do not support the vascular disruption hypothesis. However, the observation that increased ORs for some vasoactive exposures were confined to older women raises the question of whether inherent maternal factors might influence risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Individuals with fetal growth restrictions may become unhealthy as adult if they live in a nutritionally rich environment. Yet, there is little evidence for the counterpart that profuse resources during early development may prove detrimental in an impoverished adult environment. Using birth season as a proxy for nutrition in utero, this study tests whether early life effects on longevity are conditional on the environment in which people reside during adulthood. METHODS: I used Cox proportional hazard models of mortality after the age of 60 years among historical cohorts of French Canadian women born before 1750. Models are stratified by siblings to adjust the results for unobserved factors shared by family members. RESULTS: A birth during winter conferred the best-survival prospects in the south of the Saint-Lawrence River but the worse prospects in the north, where a birth during the fall was associated with the lowest mortality. Women who migrated to live on the other side of the river lost whatever advantage or disadvantage they had from their birth season and faced increases or decreases in risk that were specific to their new location. CONCLUSIONS: Based on Hales and Barker's thrifty phenotype hypothesis, and adding the "hopeful phenotype" counterpart, this study suggests that cues from the external environment during development are highly specific to that environment and that the slightest change of location may affect the chances for survival into old age. I finally address the role of fertility as a possible mediator or modifier of the effect of birth season on longevity.},

Long term risk ratio can be computed through the coupling of case referent data on exposure rates for various age categories with estimates, possibly from the study itself, of the corresponding age specific incidence densities for the exposed and nonexposed combined, but again, no rarity assumption is involved. Such data also provide for the assessment of exposure specific absolute incidence rates and risks. Point estimation of the various parameters can be based on simple relationships among them, and in interval estimation it is sufficient simply to couple the point estimate with the value of the chi square statistic used in significance testing.},

This study assesses the extent and predictors of uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP in six districts of Tanzania.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The data come from a cross-sectional survey of random households conducted in six districts in Tanzania in 2012. A total of 1,267 women, with children aged less than two years and who had sought antenatal care (ANC) at least once during pregnancy, were selected for the current analysis. Data analysis involved the use of Chi-Square ($\chi$2) for associations and multivariate analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, 43.6{\%} and 28.5{\%} of the women received optimal (two+) and partial (one) doses of IPTp-SP respectively during pregnancy. Having had been counseled on the dangers of malaria during pregnancy was the most pervasive determinant of both optimal (RRR = 6.47, 95{\%} CI 4.66-8.97) and partial (RRR = 4.24, 95{\%} CI 3.00-6.00) uptake of IPTp-SP doses. Early ANC initiation was associated with a higher likelihood of uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP (RRR = 2.05, 95{\%} CI 1.18-3.57). Also, women with secondary or higher education were almost twice as likely as those who had never been to school to have received optimal SP doses during pregnancy (RRR = 1.93, 95{\%} CI 1.04-3.56). Being married was associated with a 60{\%} decline in the partial uptake of IPTp-SP (RRR = 0.40, 95{\%} CI 0.17-0.96). Inter-district variations in the uptake of both optimal and partial IPTp-SP doses existed (P {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Counseling to pregnant women on the dangers of malaria in pregnancy and formal education beyond primary school is important to enhance uptake of optimal doses of SP for malaria control in pregnancy in Tanzania. ANC initiation in the first trimester should be promoted to enhance coverage of optimal doses of IPTp-SP. Programmes should aim to curb geographical barriers due to place of residence to enhance optimal coverage of IPTp-SP in Tanzania.},

abstract = {Selection bias due to loss to follow up represents a threat to the internal validity of estimates derived from cohort studies. Over the past 15 years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-to-event framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute mea- sure (e.g., absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, real-world data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted techniques.},

abstract = {Collider-stratification bias arises from conditioning on a variable (collider) which opens a path from exposure to outcome. M bias occurs when the collider-stratification bias is transmitted through ancestors of exposure and outcome. Previous theoretical work, but not empirical data, has demonstrated that M bias is smaller than confounding bias. The authors simulated data for large cohort studies with binary exposure, an outcome, a collider, and 2 predictors of the collider. They created 178 scenarios by changing the frequencies of variables and/or the magnitudes of associations among the variables. They calculated the effect estimate, percentage bias, and mean squared error. M bias in these realistic scenarios ranged from -2{\%} to -5{\%}. When the authors increased one or both relative risks for the relation between the collider and unmeasured factors to ≥8, the negative bias was more substantial ({\textgreater}15{\%}). The result was substantially biased (e.g., {\textgreater}20{\%}) if an unmeasured confounder that was also a collider was not adjusted to avoid M bias. In scenarios resembling those the authors examined, M bias had a small impact unless associations between the collider and unmeasured confounders were very large (relative risk {\textgreater} 8). When a collider is itself an important confounder, controlling for confounding would take precedence over avoiding M bias.},

abstract = {The mother is the only source of nutrition for fetal growth including brain development. Maternal nutritional status (anthropometry, macro- and micro-nutrients) before and/or during pregnancy is therefore a potential predictor of offspring cognitive function. The relationship of maternal nutrition to offspring cognitive function is unclear. This review aims to assess existing evidence linking maternal nutritional status with offspring cognitive function. Exposures considered were maternal BMI, height and weight, micronutrient status (vitamins D, B12, folate and iron) and macronutrient intakes (carbohydrate, protein and fat). The outcome was any measure of cognitive function in children aged {\textless}18 years. We considered observational studies and trials with allocation groups that differed by single nutrients. We searched Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases and reference lists of retrieved literature. Two reviewers independently extracted data from relevant articles. We used methods recommended by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Of 16,143 articles identified, 38 met inclusion criteria. Most studies were observational, and from high-income settings. There were few randomized controlled trials. There was consistent evidence linking maternal obesity with lower cognitive function in children; low maternal BMI has been inadequately studied. Among three studies of maternal vitamin D status, two showed lower cognitive function in children of deficient mothers. One trial of folic acid supplementation showed no effects on the children's cognitive function and evidence from 13 observational studies was mixed. Among seven studies of maternal vitamin B12 status, most showed no association, though two studies in highly deficient populations suggested a possible effect. Four out of six observational studies and two trials (including one in an Iron deficient population) found no association of maternal iron status with offspring cognitive function. One trial of maternal carbohydrate/protein supplementation showed no effects on offspring cognitive function. Current evidence that maternal nutritional status during pregnancy as defined by BMI, single micronutrient studies, or macronutrient intakes influences offspring cognitive function is inconclusive. There is a need for more trials especially in populations with high rates of maternal undernutrition. Registered in PROSPERO $\backslash$n CRD42013005702$\backslash$n $\backslash$n .},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent oral contraceptive (OC) use has been consistently associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but evidence on specific breast cancer subtypes is sparse. METHODS: We investigated recency and duration of OC use in relation to molecular subtypes of breast cancer in a pooled analysis of data from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium. The study included 1,848 women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, 1,043 with ER-negative (ER-) breast cancer (including 494 triple negative (TN) tumors, which do not have receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor 2), and 10,044 controls. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for exposure categories relative to never use, controlling for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: OC use within the previous 5 years was associated with increased risk of ER+ (OR 1.46, 95{\%} CI 1.18 to 1.81), ER- (OR 1.57, 95{\%} CI 1.22 to 1.43), and TN (OR 1.78, 95{\%} CI 1.25 to 2.53) breast cancer. The risk declined after cessation of use but was apparent for ER+ cancer for 15 to 19 years after cessation and for ER- breast cancer for an even longer interval after cessation. Long duration of use was also associated with increased risk of each subtype, particularly ER-. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that OC use, particularly recent use of long duration, is associated with an increased risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer in African American women. Research into mechanisms that explain these findings, especially the association with ER- breast cancer, is needed.},

abstract = {Approaches for analyzing the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes have been the source of much debate and many publications. Much of the problem, in our view, is the conflation of time at risk with gestational age at birth (or birth weight, a proxy for gestational age). We consider the causal questions underlying such analyses with the help of a generic directed acyclic graph. We discuss competing risks and populations at risk in the context of appropriate numerators and denominators, respectively. We summarize 3 different approaches to quantifying risks with respect to gestational age, each of which addresses a distinct etiological or prognostic question (i.e., cumulative risk, prospective risk, or instantaneous risk (hazard)) and suggest the appropriate denominators for each. We show how the gestational age-specific risk of perinatal death (PND) can be decomposed as the product of the gestational age-specific risk of birth and the risk of PND conditional on birth at a given gestational age. Finally, we demonstrate how failure to consider the first of these 2 risks leads to selection bias. This selection bias creates the well-known crossover paradox, thus obviating the need to posit common causes of early birth and PND other than the study exposure.},

For example, one might be interested in the extent to which the effect of diet on blood pressure is mediated through sodium intake and the extent to which it operates through other pathways. In the context of such mediation analysis, even if the effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded, estimates of direct and indirect effects will be biased if control is not made for confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship. Often data are not collected on such mediator-outcome confounding variables; the results in this paper allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of their estimates of direct and indirect effects to the biases from such confounding. Specifically, the paper provides formulas for the bias in estimates of direct and indirect effects due to confounding of the exposure-mediator relationship and of the mediator-outcome relationship. Under some simplifying assumptions, the formulas are particularly easy to use in sensitivity analysis. The bias formulas are illustrated by examples in the literature concerning direct and indirect effects in which mediator-outcome confounding may be present.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The two-fold purpose of this analysis is first to contrast the maternal risk factors and birth outcomes of American Indians (AIs) with other race/ethnic groups and to compare the maternal risk factors and birth outcomes of AIs by region to assess whether there are geographic variations in the adverse outcomes that might suggest intervention strategies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN: This study used the National Center for Health Statistics live birth infant death cohort files from 1995-2001. Singleton live births to U.S. resident mothers were selected. The analyses were limited to non-Hispanic American Indians, including Aleuts and Eskimos (n = 239,494), Non-Hispanic White (n = 15,488,133), and Hispanic births (n = 5,284,978).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This comparison of birth characteristics and outcomes by ethnic group revealed that AIs have more adverse maternal risk factors (e.g., unmarried and {\textless}18 years of age) than Whites and Hispanics. After adjustment for these factors, AIs have higher risks of low birth weight and preterm birth and elevated risks of postneonatal and infant mortality. Their cause-specific rates for perinatal, SIDS, injury and infection are also higher. The regional analysis indicated the South/Northeast have more low birth weight and preterm problems, but the Mid-West has the highest risks of infant mortality among LBW infants gestational age-specific mortality rates, and mortality from SIDS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data show that AIs are not a homogenous group as evinced by distinct regional differences. SIDS is mainly a problem in the Mid-West, suggesting the involvement of environmental factors in that region. Further investigation is needed to examine the current AI perinatal health concerns.},

"The consequences of any experience that children from a particular ethnic group have in their own home environments depends on the history of intergroup relations in that group's current societal context and the gress of connectedness between family life and other societal institutions designed to support child well-being."
"Thus, there is reason to suspect that certain aspects of the home environment may be less strongly associated with child behavior and development in older children"
"estimates of the heritability of many characteristics increase with age, suggestive of more active selection of environments deemed desirable by children as they grow older."
"Relatedly, Scarr (1992) and others (eg Rowe, Jacobson, Van den Oord 1999) have arged that environmental influences are greatest in conditions that pose a risk or hazard for development."
"Rowe and colleagues (1999) recently found that environmental conditions shared by members of the same family had greater influence in families in which mothers had low educational attainment as compared with families in which mothers had high educational attainment."

"The HLM analyses revealed a complicated set of relations between HOME-SF scores and children's behavior problems"
"Overall, fewer behavior problems were observed among children from families with more positive HOME-SF Scale scores, especially when children were older. The patter of association varied as a function of both ethnicity and poverty status, however."
"Pairwise comparisons indicated that associations between learning stimulation and the BPI were stronger among European American children... than among African American children"
"The fact that learning stimulation in this study was associated with children's behavior problems in every ethnic group from early childhood through adolescence, despite controlling for family demographics, parental responsiveness, and the level of spanking, suggests that theories about the causes and maintenance of behavior problems may need to be expanded to consider the roles played by the object environment and direct efforts of parents to provide learning opportunities for their children."
"Other researchers have also observed that the relation between harsh parenting and behavior problems increases with age (Pettit et al., 1997)"},

abstract = {Endometriosis is a common gynecologic problem of unknown etiology. Estrogen dependence and immune modulation are established features of this disease and recently environmental contaminants have been suggested to play a role in the pathobiology of endometriosis as well. Previous work in nonhuman primates has shown that exposure to the dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is associated with an increased prevalence and severity of endometriosis. Further animal experiments have implicated dioxin and dioxin-like compounds in this disease. Rodent studies support the plausibility for a role of environmental contaminants in the pathophysiology of endometriosis although a convincing mechanistic hypothesis has yet to be advanced. Small hospital-based case-control  studies have failed to provide compelling evidence for or against an association  of environmental contaminants and endometriosis. Herein we review the available literature that provides evidence that dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are potent modulators of immune and endocrine function critical to the pathobiology of endometriosis. Furthermore, perspectives on the potential mechanism(s) of dioxin and dioxin-like compound-induced toxicity in endometriosis, important knowledge needs, potential animal models for endometriosis studies, and considerations integral to future human case-control studies are discussed.},

abstract = {The prevalence of maternal obesity has risen dramatically in recent years, with approximately one in five pregnant women in the UK now classed as obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ) at antenatal booking. Obesity during pregnancy has been hypothesized to exert long-term health effects on the developing child through 'early life programming'. While this phenomenon has been well studied in a maternal undernutrition paradigm, the processes by which the programming effects of maternal obesity are mediated are less well understood. In humans, maternal obesity has been associated with a number of long-term adverse health outcomes in the offspring, including lifelong risk of obesity and metabolic dysregulation with increased insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, as well as behavioural problems and risk of asthma. The complex relationships between the maternal metabolic milieu and the developing foetus, as well as the potential influence of postnatal lifestyle and environment, have complicated efforts to study the programming effects of maternal overnutrition in humans. This review will examine the emerging evidence from human studies linking maternal obesity to adverse offspring outcomes.},

Data on cases from previous studies and/or the literature were used to determine whether there is an association between the sides involved in the defects. The 88 adequately described cases identified included 20 with de Lange syndrome, seven with Poland anomaly, four with trisomy 18, 52 with other patterns of multiple malformations and five with diaphragmatic and limb defects alone. Evaluation of the position of the limb (left, right, bilateral) and the diaphragmatic defects (left, right, bilateral) did not show significant association in patterns of sidedness (P = 0.48). In 56{\%} of cases, the limb deficiencies were bilateral. Among the 32 unilateral cases, 19 (59{\%}) were ipsilateral (15 left; 4 right) and 13(41{\%}) were contralateral (P = 0.38). Eleven of the 13 contralateral cases had left sided diaphragmatic defects and right sided limb deficiency; four had de Lange syndrome and nine had other patterns of multiple anomalies. Only cases with Poland anomaly or otherwise isolated defects showed a trend towards ipsilateral defects. Most cases with multiple congenital anomalies, had limbs defects on both the right and left (57{\%}) or both sides of the diaphragm were affected (an additional 10{\%}), indicating a widespread dysmorphogenetic process rather than a more restricted field defect. In other cases, defects were bilateral or, if unilateral, reflected the propensities for diaphragmatic defects to more often involve the left side, and limb defects, the right.},

Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Birthweight is associated with cognition and educational attainment across the full birthweight range in the normal population, independently of social background. However, the extent to which birthweight reflects fetal growth, or is a marker of subsequent size, with respect to this association, is not clear. We therefore investigated the independent effects of birthweight and postnatal height adjusted for postnatal weight on cognitive function and educational attainment while controlling for family background. METHODS: Using the British 1946 birth cohort we investigated the association between cognitive function at various ages and birthweight, height adjusted for weight in childhood and adulthood, and educational attainment, controlling for sex, father's social class, maternal education, birth order, and maternal age. RESULTS: Birthweight was positively associated with cognition up to age 26, and with the likelihood of obtaining advanced educational qualifications. Height was positively associated with cognition at all ages, and also with educational attainment. Weight was not associated with cognition at ages 8 and 15, but was negatively associated with verbal ability at age 26, with verbal memory at age 43, and with educational attainment. These effects were independent of each other, and of family background. Conditional analyses suggested the positive effect of height growth on cognition at two intervals, one in early childhood, and the other in late adolescence. In addition, weight gain after age 15 was negatively associated with cognition at 26. CONCLUSION: Birthweight and postnatal growth are independently associated with cognition.},

annote = {Endometriosis: Etiology and Epidemiology
Endometriosis is a gynecologic disease, considered benign, that can cause pelvic pain, painful menstruation, infertility, and painful intercourse in women, mostly between menarche and menopause. Defined by the presence of endometrial-type glands and stroma outside of the uterus, endometriosis can take several forms, including as endometriomas, which are blood-filled ovarian cysts, or as peritoneal lesions of such tissue. Occasionally endometriosis has been found in locations distant from the uterus, such as the lungs or limbs, or in scar tissue.5
The exact mechanisms of the disease have not been determined, and it is quite probable that several are possible, perhaps sometimes occurring simultaneously. The first to be suggested and still the most commonly quoted is the theory of retrograde menstruation, by which menstrual fluid regurgitated through the fallopian tubes would attach itself to tissue outside the uterus. This hypothesis is supported by the location of much endometriosis (the ovary, cul-de-sac, and uterosacral ligaments are the most common5) and by the fact that endometriosis is much more common in those women who have retrograde menstruation than those who don't.[i]
Further explanation is required, however, for the fact that most women have such retrograde menstruation.[ii] There is something therefore specific to women with endometriosis, perhaps an immunodeficiency that prevents the body from sufficiently cleaning this misplaced tissue out of the peritoneal cavity. Perhaps instead, some molecular abnormality in affected women allows the retrograde menstruation to stick, or perhaps it is some combination of the two hypotheses.11
Another etiological theory involves the dissemination of endometriotic tissue through lymphatic channels or through blood vessels, especially to the distant sites where it can appear, though this is difficult to prove.[iii] As endometriosis can also appear in the tissue of laparotomy or caesarian-section scars, perhaps it can also be directly implanted by way of a surgical instrument or something similar.5 Another possible explanation is that metaplasia of the peritoneal mesothelium can produce endometrial tissue.12
Though some risk factors for endometriosis have been ascertained, better knowledge about the mechanisms of the disease could greatly help the search for more. Furthermore, it is very difficult to get population-wide epidemiological data about endometriosis, as many cases are asymptomatic. In addition, diagnosis requires surgery, usually laparoscopic, which is not necessarily available at equal rates across a population, making the diagnosis itself a privileged one. It has been suggested that endometriosis is more frequent in higher socioeconomic groups, or among white Americans rather than African-Americans, but these difference may be attributed to lack of access to the diagnostic procedure.10
Estimates vary, but endometriosis appears to affect as little as 4{\%} or as much as 10{\%} of women of reproductive age. 11, [iv] Again, asymptomatic cases make these estimates difficult, but studies of women undergoing tubal ligation, with no previous diagnosis of endometriosis, have found that somewhere between 1-7{\%} of women without symptoms, or who fail to recognize they have them, could be surgically diagnosed with the disease.13
One of the main associations found with endometriosis is infertility, though this could be confounded by the fact that infertile women are more likely to be examined for a possible cause and therefore diagnosed with endometriosis. Similarly, pregnancy has been called a protective factor, though, similar to the case with ovarian cancer, this is hard to untangle from infertility.10
Some of the more certain protective factors are smoking and exercise, most likely because they can lead to estrogen deficiency.10 Conversely, alcohol use is a risk factor because of its ability to increase estrogen levels.13 On the whole, anything that raises estrogen appears to be problematic, as estrogen can allow endometriotic tissue to persist.11
As with ovarian cancer, family history is a strong predictor of endometriosis, raising the risk perhaps as much as seven-fold.11 Unlike the BRCA genes, however, there is currently no consensus on any “endometriosis gene.” Knowledge of family history is important in precipitating a diagnosis, as is infertility.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Two demographically similar counties included in the New York Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network had very different prevalence rates. This study examined the components of the surveillance in an attempt to discover the reasons for this discrepancy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Erie County and Monroe County were the 2 most populous counties included in the New York Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network. Erie County includes Buffalo, the second largest city in New York State, and Monroe County includes Rochester, the third largest city. Multiple sources of ascertainment included birth defect surveillance systems, genetic clinics, and early intervention programs. The case definition was based on the Institute of Medicine criteria of an abnormality in each of the following 3 areas: facial features, central nervous system, and growth.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Children born in Erie County or Monroe County between 1995 and 1999 were included. The fetal alcohol syndrome prevalence rates in these 2 counties were 0.90 cases per 1000 births and 0.21 cases per 1000 births, respectively. The 2 counties were demographically similar and had similar rates of binge drinking among women of childbearing age. There was less participation in the surveillance system by sources in Monroe County. Erie County had a very active clinician with a specialized fetal alcohol syndrome clinic.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The participation of clinicians in one county, especially one with expertise in fetal alcohol syndrome, was the most likely explanation for the differences in prevalence rates between the counties.},

abstract = {Large sample properties of the likelihood function when the true pa-rameter value may be on the boundary of the parameter space are de-scribed. Specifically, the asymptotic distribution of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio statistics are derived. These results gen-eralize the work of Moran (1971), Chant (1974), and Chernoff (1954). Some of Chant's results are shown to be incorrect. The approach used in deriving these results follows from comments made by Moran and Chant. The problem is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the problem of estimating the restricted mean of a multi-variate Gaussian distribution from a sample of size 1. In this represen-tation the Gaussian random variable corresponds to the limit of the normalized score statistic and the estimate of the mean corresponds to the limit of the normalized maximum likelihood estimator. Thus the limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the same as the distribution of the projection of the Gaussian random variable onto the region of admissible values for the mean. A variety of examples is provided for which the limiting distributions of likelihood ratio statistics are mixtures of chi-squared distributions. One example is provided with a nuisance parameter on the boundary for which the asymptotic distribution is not a mixture of chi-squared distributions.},

@article{Zeisel2011,
abstract = {Fetal progenitor cells proliferate, migrate, differentiate and undergo apoptosis at specific times during fetal development. Choline is needed by these cells for membrane synthesis and for methylation. There is growing evidence that this nutrient also modulates epigenetic regulation of gene expression in both neuronal and endothelial progenitor cells, thereby modifying brain development. It is likely that these mechanisms explain why, in rodent models, maternal dietary intake of choline influences both angiogenesis and neurogenesis in fetal hippocampus, and results in life-long changes in memory function. This also may explain why women eating diets low in choline have a greater risk of having a baby with a birth defect. Choline is mainly found in foods that contain fat and cholesterol, and intake of such foods has diminished in response dietary advice from nutritionists and physicians. Forty years ago, diets commonly contained choline-rich foods but now women in the USA tend to eat diets low in choline content. Premenopausal women normally may require less choline in their diet than do men and postmenopausal women, because estrogen induces the gene for the enzyme catalyzing endogenous biosynthesis of the choline-containing phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. However, many women have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that blocks the induction of endogenous biosynthesis, thereby making them require more dietary choline. When these women eat diets low in choline, the supply of this nutrient to the fetus is likely to be inadequate, and may perturb progenitor cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and apoptosis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Regular case-control sampling is an extremely common design used to generate data to estimate effects of exposures or treatments on a binary outcome of interest when the proportion of cases (i.e., binary outcome equal to 1) in the population of interest is low. Case-control sampling represents a biased sample of a target population of interest by sampling a disproportional number of cases. Case-control studies are also commonly employed to estimate the effects of genetic markers or biomarkers on binary phenotypes. In this article we present a general method of estimation relying on knowing the prevalence probability, conditional on the matching variable if matching is used. Our general proposed methodology, involving a simple weighting scheme of cases and controls, maps any estimation method for a parameter developed for prospective sampling from the population of interest into an estimation method based on case-control sampling from this population. We show that this case-control weighting of an efficient estimator for a prospective sample from the target population of interest maps into an efficient estimator for matched and unmatched case-control sampling. In particular, we show how application of this generic methodology provides us with double robust locally efficient targeted maximum likelihood estimators of the causal relative risk and causal odds ratio for regular case control sampling and matched case control sampling. Various extensions and generalizations of our methods are discussed.},

Moreover, a review of the literature indicates that the positive association between spanking and child behavior problems is bidirectional for White families, whereas it is the product of reverse causation (i.e., negative child behaviors result in spanking) in Black families. The implications of these sociocultural differences for parent training programs and the family study of disruptive behaviors are discussed.},

Recently, many articles have been published in the epidemiologic literature demonstrating the need for appropriate models to accommodate competing risks when they are present. However, there has been little attention to variable selection for confounder control in competing risk analyses. Methods: We employ simulation to demonstrate the bias in two variable selection strategies include covariates that are associated with the exposure and (1) which change the cause-specific hazard of any of the outcomes; or (2) which change the cause-specific hazard of the specific event of interest. Results: We demonstrated minimal to no bias in estimators adjusted for confounders of exposure and either the event of interest or the competing event, but bias of varying magnitude in almost all estimators adjusted only for confounders of exposure and the primary outcome. Discussion: When estimating causal effects for which there are com- peting risks, the analysis should control for confounders of both the exposure–primary outcome effect and of the exposure–competing outcome effect.},

The children participated between 2003 and 2008 in a neuropsychological assessment of cognitive ability including IQ tests taken by both the mother and the child. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between parental BMI and child IQ adjusted for a comprehensive set of potential confounders. Child IQ was assessed with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence - Revised (WPPSI-R).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The crude association between maternal BMI and child IQ showed that BMI was adversely associated with child IQ with a reduction in IQ of -0.40 point for each one unit increase in BMI. This association was attenuated after adjustment for social factors and maternal IQ to a value of -0.27 (-0.50 to -0.03). After mutual adjustment for the father's BMI and all other factors except maternal IQ, the association between paternal BMI and child IQ yielded a regression coefficient of -0.26 (-0.59 to 0.07), which was comparable to that seen for maternal BMI (-0.20 (-0.44 to 0.04)).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Although maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was inversely associated with the IQ of her child, the similar association with paternal BMI suggests that it is not a specific pregnancy related adiposity effect.},

Long term risk ratio can be computed through the coupling of case referent data on exposure rates for various age categories with estimates, possibly from the study itself, of the corresponding age specific incidence densities for the exposed and nonexposed combined, but again, no rarity assumption is involved. Such data also provide for the assessment of exposure specific absolute incidence rates and risks.

abstract = {In diverse fields of empirical research—including many in the biological sciences—attempts are made to decom-pose the effect of an exposure on an outcome into its effects via a number of different pathways. For example, we may wish to separate the effect of heavy alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure (SBP) into effects via body mass index (BMI), via gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and via other pathways. Much progress has been made, mainly due to contributions from the field of causal inference, in understanding the precise nature of statistical estimands that capture such intuitive effects, the assumptions under which they can be identified, and statistical methods for doing so. These contributions have focused almost entirely on settings with a single mediator, or a set of mediators considered en bloc; in many applications, how-ever, researchers attempt a much more ambitious decomposition into numerous path-specific effects through many mediators. In this article, we give counterfactual definitions of such path-specific estimands in settings with multiple mediators, when earlier mediators may affect later ones, showing that there are many ways in which decomposition can be done. We discuss the strong assumptions under which the effects are identified, suggesting a sensitivity analysis approach when a particular subset of the assumptions cannot be justified. These ideas are illustrated using data on alcohol consumption, SBP, BMI, and GGT from the Izhevsk Family Study. We aim to bridge the gap from " single mediator theory " to " multiple mediator practice, " highlighting the ambitious nature of this endeavor and giving practical suggestions on how to proceed. 1. Introduction Exploring the relative strength of different pathways from an exposure to an outcome is a topic that has interested scien-tists across diverse fields for many decades. Early literature (Wright, 1921) through to the 1980s (Bentler, 1980; Baron and Kenny, 1986) focused on path analytic approaches, based on linear regression and structural equation models (SEMs). Under stringent parametric constraints, particular combina-tions of parameters from these models were taken to represent path-specific effects. Starting with Robins and Greenland (1992), then Pearl (2001), followed by an explosion of recent contributions (see Ten Have and Joffe, 2012, and references therein, and more recent articles by VanderWeele and coauthors), the formal language and estimation methods from the field of causal in-ference have shone light on this problem and widened the scope of such analyses, under more explicit assumptions. Robins and Greenland (1992) and Pearl (2001) used poten-tial outcomes (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1978) to give model-free definitions of direct and indirect effect estimands. Informally, a direct effect acts around a mediating variable of interest, whereas the indirect effect acts through this mediator; " di-rect " thus refers to all other pathways other than through the mediator being considered. The mediator could be mul-tivariate, but if so its constituent variables are considered en bloc: the direct effect acts around them all, and the indirect effect is through at least one of them without being further disentangled (Figure 1A). In a setting with two mediators, M 1 and M 2 (see Fig-ure 1B), there are four possible pathways from exposure (X) to outcome (Y): through M 1 alone, through M 2 alone, through both and through neither. In this article, our primary aim is to express the total causal effect of X on Y as the sum of separate effects along each of the possible pathways: the finest possible decomposition. The existing literature on multiple ({\textgreater}2) pathways from exposure to outcome can be character-ized as follows; either (1) M 2 is the mediator of interest, and M 1 is treated as a mediator–outcome confounder affected by exposure, leading to a coarser two-way decomposition into an effect (indirect) through M 2 and an effect (direct) not through M 2 (Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser, 2012; Vansteelandt and VanderWeele, 2013; VanderWeele and Chiba, 2014; Vander-Weele, Vansteelandt, and Robins, 2014), (2) path-specific effects are estimated, but not in such a way that their sum equals the total causal effect (Avin, Shpitser, and Pearl, 2005; Albert and Nelson, 2011), and (3) the multiple mediators do not causally affect one another (MacKinnon, 2000; Preacher and Hayes, 2008), that is, the arrow from M 1 to M 2 in Figure 1B is assumed absent, reducing the number of path-specific effects to three. Imai and Yamamoto (2013) fall into all three categories in different sections of their article, but at no point discuss the finest possible decomposition of the total causal effect in the presence of the arrow from M 1 to M 2 . The outline for the remainder of the article is as follows. In Section 2 we briefly review mediation estimands in the single mediator setting. In Section 3 we give our proposed},

In BT474 and MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with a small inhibitory RNA for the AhR, the antiproliferative activity of the chlorinated aromatic compounds was reversed, whereas for MCDF, only partial reversal was observed, suggesting that this compound acts through both AhR-dependent and AhR-independent pathways in these two cell lines. MCDF also inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mice in which MDA-MB-468 cells were injected directly into the mammary fat pad. These results suggest that the AhR is a potential drug target for treatment of ER-negative breast cancer.},

However, previous studies have provided a limited view on the variety of factors that commonly co-occur in these environments (e.g., other characteristics of the parents and family) and how they may collectively impact children. Knowing this information could have implications for parental interventions aimed at preventing the continuation or initiation of psychosocial problems in children. Thus, the present study simultaneously examined the association between father-perpetrated interparental aggression, father characteristics, and child psychosocial functioning in a sample of 145 men arrested for domestic violence. Results showed that of all the variables examined, paternal antisocial personality traits and interpersonal hostility were uniquely associated with overall child psychosocial impairment, externalizing problems, and attention problems. Implications for intervention programs are discussed.},

abstract = {The method of inverse probability weighting (henceforth, weighting) can be used to adjust for measured confounding and selection bias under the four assumptions of consistency, exchangeability, positivity, and no misspecification of the model used to estimate weights. In recent years, several published estimates of the effect of time-varying exposures have been based on weighted estimation of the parameters of marginal structural models because, unlike standard statistical methods, weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. As an example, the authors describe the last three assumptions using the change in viral load due to initiation of antiretroviral therapy among 918 human immunodeficiency virus-infected US men and women followed for a median of 5.8 years between 1996 and 2005. The authors describe possible tradeoffs that an epidemiologist may encounter when attempting to make inferences. For instance, a tradeoff between bias and precision is illustrated as a function of the extent to which confounding is controlled. Weight truncation is presented as an informal and easily implemented method to deal with these tradeoffs. Inverse probability weighting provides a powerful methodological tool that may uncover causal effects of exposures that are otherwise obscured. However, as with all methods, diagnostics and sensitivity analyses are essential for proper use.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Adverse childhood experiences such as physical abuse and sexual abuse have been shown to be related to subsequent unintended pregnancies and infection with sexually transmitted diseases. However, the extent to which sexual risk behaviors in women are associated with exposure to adverse experiences during childhood is not well-understood. METHODS: A total of 5,060 female members of a managed care organization provided information about seven categories of adverse childhood experiences: having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse; or having had a battered mother or substance-abusing, mentally ill or criminal household members. Logistic regression was used to model the association between cumulative categories of up to seven adverse childhood experiences and such sexual risk behaviors as early onset of intercourse, 30 or more sexual partners and self-perception as being at risk for AIDS. RESULTS: Each category of adverse childhood experiences was associated with an increased risk of intercourse by age 15 (odds ratios, 1.6-2.6), with perceiving oneself as being at risk of AIDS (odds ratios, 1.5-2.6) and with having had 30 or more partners (odds ratios, 1.6-3.8). After adjustment for the effects of age at interview and race, women who experienced rising numbers of types of adverse childhood experiences were increasingly likely to see themselves as being at risk of AIDS: Those with one such experience had a slightly elevated likelihood (odds ratio, 1.2), while those with 4-5 or 6-7 such experiences had substantially elevated odds (odds ratios, 1.8 and 4.9, respectively). Similarly, the number of types of adverse experiences was tied to the likelihood of having had 30 or more sexual partners, rising from odds of 1.6 for those with one type of adverse experience and 1.9 for those with two to odds of 8.2 among those with 6-7. Finally, the chances that a woman first had sex by age 15 also rose progressively with increasing numbers of such experiences, from odds of 1.8 among those with one type of adverse childhood experience to 7.0 among those with 6-7. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with a history of adverse childhood experiences, risky sexual behavior may represent their attempts to achieve intimate interpersonal connections. Having grown up in families unable to provide needed protection, such individuals may be unprepared to protect themselves and may underestimate the risks they take in their attempts to achieve intimacy. If so, coping with such problems represents a serious public health challenge.},

abstract = {Attitudes toward divorce are believed to play a critical role in marital quality and the probability of divorce later in life. They are traditionally understood to result from social, demographic and environmental factors, including personal experience in relationships, family values, religion and economic incentives. An alternative line of research suggests that genetically influenced psychological dispositions have an important role in divorce and other relationship attitudes as well. The integration of these two lines of research however, remains embryonic. Here we address this lacuna by exploring how social and genetic factors correlate with each other, and are modified by one another. Specifically, we find that environmental factors and life events, such as going through a divorce, moderate reported genetic influences on attitudes toward divorce. The reduction in the heritability of divorce attitudes by life events is complex however. We find that the genetic influence to select into or experience a divorce is correlated with the genetic influence toward divorce attitudes. In addition, we also identify notable sex differences in the effect of divorce itself on subsequent attitudes toward divorce. Specifically, the importance of personal experience increases among women, while the importance of familial factors increases for men.},

abstract = {Children with a chronic health condition have long been considered at excess risk for psychosocial morbidity. Despite an increasing prevalence of chronic childhood conditions and heightened concerns for the quality of life of the chronically ill, population-based studies of behavior problems among children with chronic physical conditions are rare. Findings on the epidemiology of behavior problems in a nationally representative sample of 11,699 children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in the United States are reported. Data included a 32-item parent-reported behavior problem index, measures of chronic childhood conditions, measures of school placement and performance, and sociodemographic variables. Analyses confirmed that chronic physical conditions were a significant risk factor for behavior problems, independent of sociodemographic variables. Among children these differences were observed across all subscales; among adolescents the largest differences were found for the Depression/Anxiety and Peer Conflict/Social Withdrawal subscales. Rates of extreme behavior problem scores (those in the top 10th percentile) were 1.55 times higher among children with a chronic health condition compared with children without a chronic condition (95{\%} confidence interval 1.29 to 1.86). These independent odds were lowered to 1.44 when covariates for confounding were introduced via a multivariate logistic regression. Other independent risks included the absence of either biologic parent (odds ratio 2.05), male gender (1.53), low vs high family income (1.30), low vs high maternal education (1.51), and young vs old maternal age at childbirth (2.57). Chronic health conditions were also a major risk factor for placement in special education classes and having to repeat grades.

"The Behavior Problems Index (BPI), developed by Zill, was deisnged to encompass domains of behavior similar to those covered by the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (19), but to be much shorter. Most items used in the BPI were adapted from the parent-administered Child Behavior Checklist and were chosen because of their reliability, high loading on the subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist, and their adaptability to an interview situation (20). The Child Behavior Checklist has been extensively validated and appears to discriminate moderately well between children who are referred for clinical help with behavior problems and children who are not so referred (19).

the BPI sclaes included an overall behavior prob;lem score for each of two age groups (4-11 and 12-17), with six subscales for ages 4-11 and five subscales for ages 12-17. In computing scale scores, each behavioral question was coded 1 if the parent responded "often true" or "sometimes true" and was coded 0 otherwise. These recodes were then summed to give total and subscale scores. N. Zill (communication, 9185) has reported that the scale items were designed to represent measures of some of the "common syndromes of problem behavior found in children and adolescents." The subscales included the following: Headstrong......

Factor analyses of the items using prinicpal components followed by a principal components analysis with varimax rotation were carried out for a series of populations: separately for males and females aged 4-11 and 12-17; and separately for subjcets who had or had not ever seen a psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychoanalyst, ages 4-11 and 12-17. The unrotated principal components analysis within each age, gender, and chronic condition grouping confirmed the presence of a major first factor as reported by Zill (communication, 1985). This first factor explained 22{\%} to 30{\%} of the variance. All but a few of the items loaded on this first factor at a level of .40 or greater. The rotated factor analysis by subgroup confiremed the clustering of items identified by Zill, with the exception o no clear0cut peer conflict/social withdrawal grouping among children aged 4-11. A confirmation was generally indicated by a loading of the items on a factor of .40 or higher.

Estimates of internal consistency reliability of the scales were made by using coefficient alpha. These analyses indicated good reliability of the scales, for children and adolescents both with and without a chromic health condition, particularly given the small number of items on the subscales (4-6). Reliability averaged .69 across the subscales or children and adolescents without a chronic condition and .70 for those with a condition. Missing values on items making up the behavioral scales were accounted for by weighting observed scores....

In addition to looking at mean differences in behavior problem scores, we also derived a dichotomous variable that identified the approximate top 10th percentile of subjects with extreme behavior problem scores; the cutoffwas a score of 14 or more behavior problems ("sometimes" or "often" responses) on the BPI. This cutoff score was substantially related to whether subjects had been referred to mental health professionals (reported in the results section), and this discrimination can be seen as a validation of the BPI.(19)"

r = .28 for BPI score and visit to psych... "For children who scored in te top 10th percentile of the BPI, the rate was 25{\%} vs. 4{\%} for all otehr children (P {\textless} 0.001). This difference of 21{\%} was changed little by controlling for the variables outlined in Table 3 in a multiple regression analysis."},

Results: The risk of gastroschisis in offspring of women {\textless}20 years old was not significantly associated with parental Hispanic ethnicity or acculturation. Among mothers ≥20 years old, US-born non-Hispanic white parents had a lower risk of gastroschisis in offspring as compared to either US-born Hispanic (odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 0.55 to 0.60) or English-speaking Hispanic (ORs ranging from 0.58 to 0.65) parents. Further, compared with US born Hispanic women ≥20 years, the risk of gastroschisis was lower for Hispanic women who had lived in the US {\textless}5 years (OR=0.35, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.17, 0.74) or who migrated to the US at ≥20 years (OR=0.47, 95{\%} CI: 0.25, 0.88). Conclusion: These results provide further evidence that gastroschisis risk is associated with ethnicity and some aspects of acculturation. Additionally, these associations were limited to the offspring of women who are ≥20 at the time of conception.

abstract = {Various approaches using the maximum likelihood (ML) option of the LISREL program and products of indicators have been proposed to analyze structural equation models with non-linear latent effects on the basis of Kenny and Judd's formulation. Recently, some methods based off the Bayesian approach and the exact ML approaches have been developed. This article reviews, elaborates and compares several approaches for analyzing nonlinear models with interaction and/or quadratic effects. A total of four approaches arc examined, including the product indicator ML approaches proposed by Jaccard and Wan (1995) and Joreskog and Yang (1996), a Bayesian approach and an exact ML approach. The empirical performances of these approaches are assessed using simulation studies in terms of their capabilities in producing reliable parameter and standard error estimates. It is found that whilst the Bayesian and the exact ML approaches produce satisfactory results in all the settings under consideration, and are in general very reliable; the product indicator ML approaches only produce reasonable results in Simple models with large sample sizes.},

abstract = {Increasingly, clinical research is evaluated on the quality of its statistical analysis. Traditionally, statistical analyses in clinical research have been carried out from a ‘frequentist' perspective.The presence of an alternative paradigm – the Bayesian paradigm – has been relatively unknown in clini- cal research until recently. There is currently a growing interest in the use of Bayesian statistics in health care research.This is due both to a growing realization of the limitations of frequentist methods and to the ability of Bayesian methods explicitly to incorporate prior expert knowledge and belief into the analyses. This is in contrast to frequentist methods, where prior experience and beliefs tend to be incorporated into the analyses in an ad hoc fashion.This paper outlines the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms. Acute myocardial infarction mortality data are then analysed from both a Bayesian and a frequentist perspective. In some analyses, the two methods are seen to produce comparable results; in others, they produce different results. It is noted that in this example, there are clinically relevant ques- tions that are more easily addressed from a Bayesian perspective. Finally, areas in clinical research where Bayesian ideas are increasingly common are highlighted},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: At present, the only way to conclusively diagnose endometriosis is laparoscopic inspection, preferably with histological confirmation. This contributes to the delay in the diagnosis of endometriosis which is 6-11 years. So far non-invasive diagnostic approaches such as ultrasound (US), MRI or blood tests do not have sufficient diagnostic power. Our aim was to develop and validate a non-invasive diagnostic test with a high sensitivity (80{\%} or more) for symptomatic endometriosis patients, without US evidence of endometriosis, since this is the group most in need of a non-invasive test.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 28 inflammatory and non-inflammatory plasma biomarkers were measured in 353 EDTA plasma samples collected at surgery from 121 controls without endometriosis at laparoscopy and from 232 women with endometriosis (minimal-mild n = 148; moderate-severe n = 84), including 175 women without preoperative US evidence of endometriosis. Surgery was done during menstrual (n = 83), follicular (n = 135) and luteal (n = 135) phases of the menstrual cycle. For analysis, the data were randomly divided into an independent training (n = 235) and a test (n = 118) data set. Statistical analysis was done using univariate and multivariate (logistic regression and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) approaches in training- and test data set separately to validate our findings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the training set, two models of four biomarkers (Model 1: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and glycodelin; Model 2: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1) analysed in plasma, obtained during the menstrual phase, could predict US-negative endometriosis with a high sensitivity (81-90{\%}) and an acceptable specificity (68-81{\%}). The same two models predicted US-negative endometriosis in the independent validation test set with a high sensitivity (82{\%}) and an acceptable specificity (63-75{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In plasma samples obtained during menstruation, multivariate analysis of four biomarkers (annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1/or glycodelin) enabled the diagnosis of endometriosis undetectable by US with a sensitivity of 81-90{\%} and a specificity of 63-81{\%} in independent training- and test data set. The next step is to apply these models for preoperative prediction of endometriosis in an independent set of patients with infertility and/or pain without US evidence of endometriosis, scheduled for laparoscopy.},

abstract = {The number of births varies markedly by season, but the causes of this variation are not well understood. The proposed explanations include temperature or photoperiod (affecting hormonal concentrations, sperm quality or sexual activity), seasonal variation in pregnancy loss, or cultural factors. In this paper we examined whether birth seasonality is influenced by socio-demographic factors. We used data on all live births registered in the Czech Republic in 1989-1991 (n = 387 496). Differences in the degree of seasonality between socio-demographic groups (defined by maternal age, marital status, education and birth order) were examined by inspection of curves, by comparing coefficients of variations of monthly numbers of births, and by calculating the ratios of the number of births in the 3 peak months (March to May) to the number of births in the 3 lowest months (October to December). We found large differences in the size of the seasonal variation in births by socio-demographic factors. The seasonal variation was highly pronounced in mothers who were 25-34 years old, had higher education, were married, and were pregnant with their second or third child. By contrast, birth seasonality was weak in mothers who were {\textless} or =19 years or {\textgreater} or =35 years old, unmarried, had low education, and expected their first or fourth or higher order birth. In a multivariate model, all four socio-demographic variables contributed significantly to seasonal variation. These results suggest that the seasonality of births is, at least in this population, strongly influenced by socio-demographic factors.},

abstract = {Low maternal education is consistently associated with increased risk of preterm delivery (PTD). The interpregnancy interval (IPI), defined as the time between the date of a previous birth and the conception date of the index pregnancy, may mediate this relationship. We estimated controlled direct effects to assess whether hypothetical interventions designed to increase IPIs would reduce the educational disparity in PTD. We introduce a technique for estimating controlled direct effects under interventions that set only some persons in the population to a specific mediator value. We used data from 847,618 singleton livebirths occurring in Quebec, Canada, between 1989 and 2010. Compared with mothers with some university education (≥14 years), mothers with less than high school ({\textless}11 years), high school (11 years), and some college (12-13 years) had excess PTD risks of 2.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 2.4, 2.8), 1.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.4, 1.7), and 1.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.9, 1.1), respectively. Risk differences under an intervention corresponding to the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing the number of mothers with IPIs less than 18 months by 3{\%} were no different from those for the total relationship. Our results suggest that interventions designed to increase the length of short IPIs will yield no important change in the PTD disparity by maternal educational level.},

abstract = {It is widely recognized American Indians and Alaska Natives have suffered from far worse health status than that of other Americans. Health communication campaigns directed to American Indians and Alaska Natives and their outcomes must be grounded in an understanding of the historical and ongoing marginalization and cultural dislocation of these groups. The authors draw upon the specific case of health communication campaigns to reduce cases of fetal alcohol syndrome among American Indians and Alaska Natives. Counteracting stereotyping of American Indians and alcohol consumption by mainstream American popular culture and mediated discourses, coverage of fetal alcohol syndrome in the media is assessed. The study analyzes 429 American Indian news articles from 1990 to 2010. Mainstream American and American Indian media should cover health concerns such as fetal alcohol syndrome more extensively. Researchers, health communication campaign developers, health policy makers, and mainstream media must be knowledgeable about American Indian and Alaskan Native identity, cultures, and history, and diversity across Nations. Last, and most important, health communication strategists and health policy makers must welcome American Indians and Alaska Natives to take leadership roles in communicating culture- and Nation-specific health campaign strategies to eliminate health disparities.},
annote = {
"The 'practice of Euro-American subjugation of indigenous America' (Morris, 2003, p. 126) is evident in the lack of culture- and Nation-specific health communication campaigns directed to American Indians/Alaska Natives."


"Weibel-Orlando (1989) argued the most successful programs shared the following characteristics: They were created by American Indians, facilitated by dynamic American Indian leaders and role models, involved those participating in the program as both participants in recovery and healers in a group/collaborative approach, and incorporated a social structure. Ideally a specific community center should be used where those in recovery would have a social life that did not use alcohol."

"Anderson (2000) suggests a campaign that focuses on the women elders modeling the tribal ways that seek respect for childbearing women."

"Several researchers (...) verified any alcohol or other substance prevention campaigns must include these positives: history, traditional practices, and spirituality. ... introduced social support (emotional and instrumental) and social undermining variables (critical appraisal and isolation) as correlates for alcohol, drug, and mental disorders among American Indian women. Interventions should give participants the skills to negotiate the negatives: discrimination, historical loss, and enculturation."

"One of our previous studies... analyzed the audiorecorded health visits at a federally funded clinic between Indian women and a young White middle class physician, the emerging pattern revealed cultural and class disparity. The differences in power hindered the women patients to contribute comfortably to the discussion with their physician."

"However, it is important to recognize that althought prevention health campaigns can be extremely effective in increasing awareness and knowledge of risk factors, intervention campaigns are needed for those who are practicing unhealthy behaviors such as drinking while pregnant.... 'refer for treatment all women of childbearing age who have problems associated with substance abuse, such as depression, sexual abuse, and injuries.' (Kvigne et al., 2003, p. 302)."

"We encourage work with Indians on campaigns from the inside out making the campaign an extension of the American Indians' various cultures."},

We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine the following algorithms for forming matched pairs of treated and untreated subjects: optimal matching, greedy nearest neighbor matching without replacement, and greedy nearest neighbor matching without replacement within specified caliper widths. For each of the latter two algorithms, we examined four different sub-algorithms defined by the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching to an untreated subject: lowest to highest propensity score, highest to lowest propensity score, best match first, and random order. We also examined matching with replacement. We found that (i) nearest neighbor matching induced the same balance in baseline covariates as did optimal matching; (ii) when at least some of the covariates were continuous, caliper matching tended to induce balance on baseline covariates that was at least as good as the other algorithms; (iii) caliper matching tended to result in estimates of treatment effect with less bias compared with optimal and nearest neighbor matching; (iv) optimal and nearest neighbor matching resulted in estimates of treatment effect with negligibly less variability than did caliper matching; (v) caliper matching had amongst the best performance when assessed using mean squared error; (vi) the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching had at most a modest effect on estimation; and (vii) matching with replacement did not have superior performance compared with caliper matching without replacement.},

abstract = {The prevalence of childhood obesity in the United States has tripled since the 1980s and is strongly linked to the early onset of several metabolic diseases. Recent studies indicate that lower cognitive function may be another complication of childhood obesity. This review considers the research to date on the role of obesity and nutrition on childhood cognition and brain health. Although a handful of studies point to a maladaptive relationship between obesity and aspects of cognitive control, remarkably little is known regarding the impact of fat mass on brain development and cognitive function. Further, missing from the literature is the role of nutrition in the obesity-cognition interaction. Nutrition may directly or indirectly influence cognitive performance via several pathways including provision of key substrates for optimal brain health, modulation of gut microbiota, and alterations in systemic energy balance. However, in the absence of malnutrition, the functional benefits of specific nutrient intake on particular cognitive domains are not well characterized. Here, we examine the literature linking childhood obesity and cognition while considering the effects of nutritional intake. Possible mechanisms for these relationships are discussed and suggestions are made for future study topics. Although childhood obesity prevalence rates in some developed countries have recently stabilized, significant disparities remain among groups based on sex and socioeconomic status. Given that the elevated prevalence of pediatric overweight and obesity may persist for the foreseeable future, it is crucial to develop a comprehensive understanding of the influence of obesity and nutrition on cognition and brain health in the pediatric population.},

@article{RocaFeltrer2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is currently no standard way of defining malaria seasonality, resulting in a wide range of definitions reported in the literature. Malaria cases show seasonal peaks in most endemic settings, and the choice and timing for optimal malaria control may vary by seasonality. A simple approach is presented to describe the seasonality of malaria, to aid localized policymaking and targeting of interventions. METHODS: A series of systematic literature reviews were undertaken to identify studies reporting on monthly data for full calendar years on clinical malaria, hospital admission with malaria and entomological inoculation rates (EIR). Sites were defined as having 'marked seasonality' if 75{\%} or more of all episodes occurred in six or less months of the year. A 'concentrated period of malaria' was defined as the six consecutive months with the highest cumulative proportion of cases. A sensitivity analysis was performed based on a variety of cut-offs. RESULTS: Monthly data for full calendar years on clinical malaria, all hospital admissions with malaria, and entomological inoculation rates were available for 13, 18, and 11 sites respectively. Most sites showed year-round transmission with seasonal peaks for both clinical malaria and hospital admissions with malaria, with a few sites fitting the definition of 'marked seasonality'. For these sites, consistent results were observed when more than one outcome or more than one calendar year was available from the same site. The use of monthly EIR data was found to be of limited value when looking at seasonal variations of malaria transmission, particularly at low and medium intensity levels. CONCLUSION: The proposed definition discriminated well between studies with 'marked seasonality' and those with less seasonality. However, a poor fit was observed in sites with two seasonal peaks. Further work is needed to explore the applicability of this definition on a wide-scale, using routine health information system data where possible, to aid appropriate targeting of interventions.},

We evaluate race differences in the processes that link poverty and single parenthood to antisocial behavior, drawing on conceptual models that link structural conditions to children's well-being through the mediating influences of parental distress and unsupportive parenting. On the basis of data from the 1988 Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data set, we find that the total effects of poverty and single parenthood on parenting practices, and of parenting practices on antisocial behavior, do not differ significantly by race. However, the processes that create those effects do vary by race. Parenting practices and antisocial behavior are reciprocally related for whites but parenting practices do not significantly predict antisocial behavior for blacks.},

abstract = {One of the characteristics of the central nervous system is the lack of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment, the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood. In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.},

"Classic lymphatic vessels, in addition to draining interstitial fluids, allow cells to travel from tissues to draining lymph nodes."

"The newly discovered meningeal lymphatic vessels are a novel path for cerebrospinal fluid drainage and represent a more conventional path for immune cells to egress the central nervous system."

"The presence of a functional and classical lymphatic system in the central nervous system suggests that current dogmas regarding brain tolerance and the immune privilege of the brain should be revisited. Malfunction of the meningeal lymphatic vessels could be a root cause of a variety of neurological disorders in which altered immunity is a fundamental player such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease..."},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate weight perception, dieting and emotional well being across the range of body mass index (BMI) in a population-based multiethnic sample of early adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based survey. SUBJECTS: In total, 2789 adolescents 11-14 years of age from three highly deprived regional authorities in East London, in 2001. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected by student-completed questionnaire on weight perception, dieting history, mental and physical health, health behaviours, social capital and sociodemographic factors. Height and weight were measured by trained researchers. Overweight was defined as BMI {\textgreater} or =85th centile and obesity as BMI {\textgreater} or =98th centile. Underweight was defined as BMI{\textless} or =15th centile. RESULTS: In all, 73{\%} were from ethnic groups other than white British. Valid BMI were available for 2522 subjects (90.4{\%}) of whom 14{\%} were obese. Only 20{\%} of overweight boys and 51{\%} of overweight girls assessed their weight accurately. Accuracy of weight perception did not vary between ethnic groups. In all, 42{\%} of girls and 26{\%} of boys reported current dieting to lose weight. Compared with white British teenagers, a history of dieting was more common among Bangladeshi, Indian and mixed ethnicity boys and less likely among Pakistani girls. Self-esteem was not associated with BMI in girls but was significantly lower in obese boys than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Within ethnic subgroups, self-esteem was significantly lower in overweight white British boys (P=0.03) and obese Bangladeshi boys (P=0.01) and Bangladeshi girls (P=0.04), but significantly higher in obese black African girls (P=0.01) than those of normal weight. Obese young people had a higher prevalence of psychological distress (P=0.04), except among Bangladeshi teenagers, where overweight and obese young people had less psychological distress than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Birth outside the UK was associated with reduced risk of obesity in girls (P=0.02) but not with history of dieting, weight perception or psychological factors in either gender. CONCLUSION: High levels of current dieting for weight control and inaccurate perception of body mass are common across all ethnic groups. However, dieting history and the associations of obesity with self-esteem and psychological distress vary between ethnic groups. Interventions to prevent or treat obesity in black or minority ethnicity groups must consider cultural differences in the relationship between body mass, self-esteem and psychological distress.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers have used a potential-outcome framework to estimate causally interpretable direct and indirect effects of an intervention or exposure on an outcome. One approach to causal-mediation analysis uses the so-called mediation formula to estimate the natural direct and indirect effects. This approach generalizes the classical mediation estimators and allows for arbitrary distributions for the outcome variable and mediator. A limitation of the standard (parametric) mediation formula approach is that it requires a specified mediator regression model and distribution; such a model may be difficult to construct and may not be of primary interest. To address this limitation, we propose a new method for causal-mediation analysis that uses the empirical distribution function, thereby avoiding parametric distribution assumptions for the mediator. To adjust for confounders of the exposure-mediator and exposure-outcome relationships, inverse-probability weighting is incorporated based on a supplementary model of the probability of exposure. This method, which yields the estimates of the natural direct and indirect effects for a specified reference group, is applied to data from a cohort study of dental caries in very-low-birth-weight adolescents to investigate the oral-hygiene index as a possible mediator. Simulation studies show low bias in the estimation of direct and indirect effects in a variety of distribution scenarios, whereas the standard mediation formula approach can be considerably biased when the distribution of the mediator is incorrectly specified.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antenatal care (ANC) is a key strategy to improve maternal and infant health. However, survey data from sub-Saharan Africa indicate that women often only initiate ANC after the first trimester and do not achieve the recommended number of ANC visits. Drawing on qualitative data, this article comparatively explores the factors that influence ANC attendance across four sub-Saharan African sites in three countries (Ghana, Kenya and Malawi) with varying levels of ANC attendance. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a programme of qualitative research investigating the social and cultural context of malaria in  pregnancy. A range of methods was employed interviews, focus groups with diverse  respondents and observations in local communities and health facilities. RESULTS: Across the sites, women attended ANC at least once. However, their descriptions of ANC were often vague. General ideas about pregnancy care - checking the foetus' position or monitoring its progress - motivated women to attend ANC; as did, especially in Kenya, obtaining the ANC card to avoid reprimands from health  workers. Women's timing of ANC initiation was influenced by reproductive concerns and pregnancy uncertainties, particularly during the first trimester, and how ANC services responded to this uncertainty; age, parity and the associated implications for pregnancy disclosure; interactions with healthcare workers, particularly messages about timing of ANC; and the cost of ANC, including charges levied for ANC procedures - in spite of policies of free ANC - combined with ideas about the compulsory nature of follow-up appointments. CONCLUSION: In these socially and culturally diverse sites, the findings suggest that 'supply' side factors have an important influence on ANC attendance: the design of ANC and particularly how ANC deals with the needs and concerns of women during the first  trimester has implications for timing of initiation.},

abstract = {This report reviews some of the more recent epidemiologic and experimental findings on the relationship of tobacco smoking to lung cancer, and discusses some criticisms directed against the conclusion that tobacco smoking, especially cigarettes, has a causal role in the increase in broncho-genic carcinoma. The magnitude of the excess lung-cancer risk among cigarette smokers is so great that the results can not be interpreted as arising from an indirect asso- ciation of cigarette smoking with some other agent or characteristic, since this hypothetical agent would have to be at least as strongly associated with lung cancer as cigarette use; no such agent has been found or suggested. The consistency of all the epidemiologic and experimental evidence also supports the conclusion of a causal relationship with cigarette smoking, while there are serious incon- sistencies in reconciling the evidence with other hypotheses which have been advanced. Unquestionably there are areas where more research is necessary, and, of course, no single cause accounts for all lung cancer. The information already available, however, is sufficient for planning and activating public health measures.},

abstract = {2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been suggested as a possible etiologic factor for endometriosis, a condition in which endometrium-like tissues are present outside the uterus. The prevailing view pertaining to the origin of endometriotic cells is that they are from eutopic endometrial cells which regurgitate through fallopian tubes. In order to get insight into the possible involvement of TCDD in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we suspected that TCDD may act differently on the endometrium with or without endometriosis. To address this, we examined the presence of messenger RNAs of arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) and two dioxin-responsive genes, cytochrome P-450 1B1 (CYP1B1) and downstream of tyrosine kinases (p62(dok)), in the endometrium of women with or without endometriosis using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All the genes were expressed throughout the menstrual cycle. The expression level of p62(dok) was higher in the proliferative phase than in the secretory phase. In contrast, the expression levels of AhR, Arnt and CYP1B1 seemed to be constant during the cycle. In terms of the comparison between non-endometriosis and endometriosis group, the mRNA levels of AhR, Arnt, CYP1B1 and p62(dok) were essentially similar. Interestingly, AhR mRNA level was significantly lower in smokers than in non-smokers. Based on the regression analysis, significant linear and positive correlations were observed between AhR and Arnt mRNA levels, and between Arnt and p62(dok) mRNA levels. In summary, expression of AhR and dioxin-related genes in the endometrium did not differ in women with or without endometriosis.},

abstract = {Background Gastroschisis, a congenital anomaly involving a defect in the fetal abdominal wall, has increased in prevalence in many countries, but the aetiology is uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that high maternal alcohol consumption and poor diet in the first trimester are risk factors in a case–control study in the UK (1 July 2007 to 28 February 2010).$\backslash$nMethods Gastroschisis cases and three controls per case (matched for maternal age) were identified at 18- to 20-week routine anomaly screening ultrasound scan (USS). Interviews were carried out during the antenatal period (median 24 weeks' gestation) using a piloted questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression was used to describe the associations between exposure variables and gastroschisis, adjusted for known confounding variables.$\backslash$nResults The response rate was 73{\%} for cases (n = 91) and 70{\%} for controls (n = 217). High consumption of fruits and vegetables during the first trimester (aOR 0.2; 95{\%} CI 0.04–0.6), taking folic acid for at least 6 weeks during the first trimester (aOR 0.3; 95{\%} CI 0.1–0.7) and increasing body fat percentage of total maternal body weight (aOR 0.9; 95{\%} CI 0.8–0.9 per 1{\%} increase) were independently associated with reduced risk. Cigarette smoking (aOR 2.7; 95{\%} CI 1.1–6.8) was an independent risk factor.$\backslash$nConclusion We report for the first time that higher intake of fruits and vegetables during the first trimester, longer duration of folic acid supplementation and higher body fat percentage are associated with reduced risk of fetal gastroschisis, independent of cigarette smoking. The increased risk of cigarette smoking is greatest in older women and in high socio-economic groups.},

abstract = {Numerous health consequences of children's exposure to maternal smoking have been demonstrated, including increased rates of low birth weight, infant mortality, respiratory infections, asthma, and modest impairments of cognitive development. There is little evidence, however, linking maternal smoking and increased rates of children's behavior problems. Data from the population-based National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were used to investigate the possible association of maternal smoking and behavior problems among 2256 children aged 4 through 11 years. In multiple regression analyses the authors controlled for child's race, age, sex, birth weight, and chronic asthma; family structure, income, and divorce or separation in the prior 2 years; mother's education, intelligence, self-esteem, employment status, chronic disabling health conditions, and use of alcohol during pregnancy; and the quality of the home environment as assessed by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form to investigate the relationship between maternal smoking and children's behavior problems. The measure of maternal smoking status reflected two levels of smoking intensity (less than a pack per day and a pack or more per day) for each of three different categories of children's exposure: prenatal only (mother smoked only during pregnancy), passive only (mother smoked only after pregnancy), and prenatal plus passive exposure (mother smoked both during and after pregnancy). Measures of children's behavior problems included the overall score on a 32-item parent-reported child Behavior Problem Index (BPI), scores on the BPI's six subscales, and rates of extreme scores on the BPI. Increased rates of children's behavior problems were found to be independently associated with all three categories of exposure to maternal cigarette smoke, with evidence suggesting a dose-response relationship. For example, among children whose mothers smoked both during and after pregnancy, there were 1.17 additional problems independently associated with smoking less than a pack per day (P = .0007) and 2.04 additional problems associated with smoking a pack or more per day (P = .0001). The odds ratio for extreme behavior problem scores for this category of exposure was 1.41 if the mother smoked less than a pack per day (P = .01) and 1.54 if she smoked a pack or more per day (P = .02). These data provide evidence suggesting that increased behavior problems of children should be added to the growing list of adverse child health conditions associated with children's prenatal and passive exposure to maternal smoking.},

"In addition to investigating the relationship between maternal smoking and mean subscale and overall BPI scores, we also derived a dichotomous varialbe that identified subjects with extreme behavior problem scores. The cutoff for this category was a score of 14 or more behavior problems ("sometimes" or "often" responses) on the BPI. In a previous study using a nationally representative sample, this score represented the approximate top 10th percentile of BPI scores, and this cutoff was substantially related to whether subjects had been referred to mental health professionals" (36)

"The properties of the BPI's overall score and subscales have been investigated and have been shown to be satisfactory via factor analyses of the items using prinicpal components analyses followed by a principal components analysis with varimax rotation as reported by N. Zill (written communication, 1985). Estimates of internal consistency reliability of the scales have been made using coefficient alpha. The total BPI had an estimated reliability of 0.90 and reliability averaged 0.70 across the subscales (36). Missing values for individual BPI items were few in number and were imputed."},

abstract = {Certain statistical models specify a conditional mean function, given a random effect and covariates of interest. On the other hand, one may instead model a marginal mean only in terms of the covariates. We discuss some common situations where conditional and marginal means coincide. In a Gaussian linear mixed effects model we have equivalent interpretations of the conditional and marginal regression parameter estimates. Similar results exist for more general link functions. In this paper we give a short overview of some models, where conditional and marginal results are equivalent and we illustrate this with some examples. When the conditional mean is additive in a random effect on the log scale, it is seen that the marginal mean equals the conditional mean plus a constant, such that slope parameters have the same interpretation in both formulations. No further distributional assumptions are needed in either of these cases. With a logit link and a double exponential random effect, a closed form marginal link function is derived from the conditional model. When a logit or probit link is used with a normal random effect, the marginal mean parameters become attenuated by a factor which depends on parameters of the distribution of the covariates. In a conditional Weibull proportional hazards model with a positive stable frailty, the marginal hazards are again Weibull but with slope parameters attenuated towards zero.},

abstract = {Intrauterine inflammation is a major risk for offspring neurodevelopmental brain damage and may result in cognitive limitations and poor cognitive and perceptual outcomes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulated during inflammatory response, have a pleotrophic effect on neurons and glia cells. They act in a dose-dependent manner, activate cell-death pathways and also act as trophic factors. In the present study, we have examined in mice the effect of short, systemic maternal inflammation on fetal brain development. Maternal inflammation, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at gestation day 17, did not affect morphogenic parameters and reflex development during the first month of life. However, maternal inflammation specifically increased the number of pyramidal and granular cells in the hippocampus, as well as the shrinkage of pyramidal cells, but not of the granular cells. No additional major morphological differences were observed in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. In accordance with the morphological effects, maternal inflammation specifically impaired distinct forms of learning and memory, but not motor function or exploration in the adult offspring. The specific deficiency observed, following maternal inflammation, may suggest particular sensitivity of the hippocampus and other associated brain regions to inflammatory factors during late embryonic development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In longitudinal studies, outcomes ascertained at follow-up are typically undefined for individuals who die prior to the follow-up visit. In such settings, outcomes are said to be truncated by death and inference about the effects of a point treatment or exposure, restricted to individuals alive at the follow-up visit, could be biased even if as in experimental studies, treatment assignment were randomized. To account for truncation by death, the survivor average causal effect (SACE) defines the effect of treatment on the outcome for the subset of individuals who would have survived regardless of exposure status. In this paper, the author nonparametrically identifies SACE by leveraging post-exposure longitudinal correlates of survival and outcome that may also mediate the exposure effects on survival and outcome. Nonparametric identification is achieved by supposing that the longitudinal data arise from a certain nonparametric structural equations model and by making the monotonicity assumption that the effect of exposure on survival agrees in its direction across individuals. A novel weighted analysis involving a consistent estimate of the survival process is shown to produce consistent estimates of SACE. A data illustration is given, and the methods are extended to the context of time-varying exposures. We discuss a sensitivity analysis framework that relaxes assumptions about independent errors in the nonparametric structural equations model and may be used to assess the extent to which inference may be altered by a violation of key identifying assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Obesity induces a low-grade inflammatory state and has been associated with behavioral and cognitive alterations. Importantly, maternal environmental insults can adversely impact subsequent offspring behavior and have been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AHDH). It is unknown if maternal obesity significantly alters offspring sociability, a key ASD feature, and if altering maternal diet will provide an efficacious intervention paradigm for behavioral deficits. Here we investigated the impact of maternal high fat diet (HFD) and maternal dietary intervention during lactation on offspring behavior and brain inflammation in mice. We found that maternal HFD increased anxiety and decreased sociability in female offspring. Additionally, female offspring from HFD-fed dams also exhibited increased brain IL-1$\beta$ and TNFΑ and microglial activation. Importantly, maternal dietary intervention during lactation was sufficient to alleviate social deficits and brain inflammation. Maternal obesity during gestation alone was sufficient to increase hyperactivity in male offspring, a phenotype that was not ameliorated by dietary intervention. These data suggest that maternal HFD acts as a prenatal/perinatal insult that significantly impacts offspring behavior and inflammation and that dietary intervention during lactation may be an easily translatable, efficacious intervention to offset some of these manifestations.},

The hypothesized model was revised; the revised model was cross validated on a split-half sample, and estimated separately by age group, gender, and race/ethnicity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The revised model fit the data well and was supported by cross-validation. Poverty, maternal birth age, parents' education, maternal depression, and marital conflict were directly or indirectly related to mothers' frequent use of physical punishment. Frequent use of physical punishment was directly related to children's socioemotional problems, as were maternal depression and marital conflict. Few subgroup differences were found.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Main findings indicate that the effect of poverty on mothers' use of physical punishment is indirect, and is mediated by maternal depression and marital conflict. Depressed mothers spank their children more frequently and experience higher levels of marital conflict, which, in turn, is directly related to their use of physical punishment. Younger, more educated mothers spank their children less often. Children who are spanked more frequently exhibit more socioemotional problems.},

This scale has a Cronbach's alpha value of .68 and a 2-week test-retest reliability of .68. We dichotomized this scale at ≥ 11, or 2SDs above the mean. We chose this cutoff in part because it yielded a prevalence for attentional problems that is similar to published reports of ADHD prevalence among similar-aged children in community samples."},

abstract = {"Nutrients available to children are determined largely by intrahousehold allocations.  There are a number of reasons why birth order may affect these allocations.  A model is developed to estimate critical parameters of parental preferences regarding the allocation of nutrients among their children.  Latent variable estimates for rural south India indicate that parental preferences have productivity-equity tradeoffs and parents favor older children.  The productivity-equity tradeoff, however, is much less for the lean season.  Therefore, when food is scarcest, parents follow more closely a pure investment strategy, exposing their more vulnerable children to greater malnutrition risk."},

Participants were 80 parent-adolescent dyads (mean age = 13.6; 79 {\%} African-American and 17 {\%} Caucasian) with diverse family composition and socioeconomic status. Parent and adolescent dyads self-reported on their emotion regulation difficulties and adolescents reported on their perceptions of parent invalidation (i.e., punishment and neglect) of emotions and their own internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results showed that parents who reported higher levels of emotion dysregulation tended to invalidate their adolescent's emotional expressions more often, which in turn related to higher levels of adolescent emotion dysregulation. Additionally, adolescent-reported emotion dysregulation mediated the relation between parent invalidation of emotions and adolescent internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Potential applied implications are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional measures of gestational weight gain (GWG) are correlated with pregnancy duration, and may induce bias to studies of GWG and perinatal outcomes. A maternal weight-gain-for-gestational-age z-score chart is a new tool that allows total GWG to be classified as a standardised z-score that is independent of gestational duration. Our objective was to compare associations with perinatal outcomes when GWG was assessed using gestational age-standardised z-scores and conventional GWG measures. METHODS: We studied normal-weight (n = 522 120) and overweight (n = 237 923) women who delivered liveborn, singleton infants in Pennsylvania, 2003-11. GWG was expressed using gestational age-standardised z-scores and three traditional measures: total GWG (kg), rate of GWG (kg per week of gestation), and the GWG adequacy ratio (observed GWG/GWG recommended by the Institute of Medicine). Log-binomial regression models were used to assess associations between GWG and preterm birth, and small- and large-for-gestational-age births, while adjusting for race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and other confounders. RESULTS: The association between GWG z-score and preterm birth was approximately U-shaped. The risk of preterm birth associated with weight gain {\textless}10th percentile of each measure was substantially overestimated when GWG was classified using total kilogram and was moderately overestimated using rate of GWG or GWG adequacy ratio. All GWG measures had similar associations with small- or large-for-gestational-age birth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that studies of gestational age-dependent outcomes misspecify associations if total GWG, rate of GWG, or GWG adequacy ratio are used. The potential for gestational age-related bias can be eliminated by using z-score charts to classify total GWG.},

Study subjects consist of 3,412 US children aged 60-83 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Mother and Child Survey. Cognitive test scores using the Peabody Individual Achievement Test reading recognition and mathematics tests were used as the outcomes of interest. Association with maternal prepregnancy obesity was examined using the ordinary least square regression controlling for intrauterine, family background, maternal and child factors. Children of obese women had 3 points (0.23 SD units) lower peabody individual achievement test (PIAT) reading recognition score (p = 0.007), and 2 points (0.16 SD units) lower PIAT mathematics scores (p {\textless} 0.0001), holding all other factors constant. As expected, cognitive test score was associated with stimulating home environment (reading: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001), household income (reading: $\beta$ = 0.03, p = 0.02 and math: $\beta$ = 0.04, p = 0.004), maternal education (reading: $\beta$ = 0.42, p = 0.0005, and math: $\beta$ = 0.32, p = 0.008), and maternal cognitive skills (reading: $\beta$ = 0.11, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.09, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was a significant association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores that could not be explained by other intrauterine, family background, maternal, and child factors. Children who live in disadvantaged postnatal environments may be most affected by the effects of maternal prepregnancy obesity. Replications of the current study using different cohorts are warranted to confirm the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores.},

"Pregnancy and birth complications are more common with excessive gestational weight gain, and therefore, weight gain during pregnancy is a significnate health concern for both motehr and child. Excessive gestational weight gain alone is a n independent factor for a number of adverse neonatal outcomes (24), which may lead to delayed child cognitive development. However, results of the current study did not demonstrate an association between maternal gestational weight gain above the IOM recommendation and cognitive test scores in our sample."

"Studies examining the relationship between birthweight and children's cognitive test scores have produced mixed results. A few studies have found a quadrativ relation (25) and other studies have found a linear relation (9, 26), or no relation at all."

"a systematic review of the studies examining the association between birth weight and cognitive skills has shown a linear relation with inconsistent results at a higher end of birth weight (28).

Within same sex sibling pairs, differences in birth weight were directly associated with differences in IQ in boys (812 pairs, predicted IQ difference per 100 g change in birth weight =0.50, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.28 to 0.71) but not girls (871 pairs, 0.10, -0.09 to 0.30).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Farming populations from developing countries are exposed to seasonal energy stress due to variations in food availability and energy output related to agricultural activities. This study aims to examine the impact of seasonality in maternal intake and activity on neonatal size. METHODS: Maternal anthropometry, dietary intakes (24-h recall and food-frequency questionnaire) and activity pattern (questionnaire) at 18 +/- 2 and 28 +/- 2 weeks gestation, and neonatal anthropometry, were measured in a prospective study of 797 rural Indian women. RESULTS: Maternal energy and protein intakes were inadequate (70{\%} of recommended dietary allowance). Both intake and activity showed seasonal variation (P = 0.001), with peak values in winter i.e. during harvest, at 18 weeks (median energy 1863 kcal/day, protein 47.5 g/day) and 28 weeks (median energy 1687 kcal/day, protein 43.7 g/day), coinciding with the maximum maternal activity (median score 86.1 at 18 weeks and 79.5 at 28 weeks). Mean birth weight and length (adjusted for pre-pregnant weight, parity, gestation and sex) of babies was highest in summer (peak at February 2733 g, 48.6 cm, respectively) and lowest in winter (nadir at January 2591 g, 47.1 cm, respectively). Regression analysis showed that maternal intake at 18th week had a positive association (P = 0.05), maternal activity at 28th week had a negative association (P = 0.002) and exposure (in weeks) to winter during gestation had a positive association (P = 0.04) with birth size. Furthermore, higher maternal intakes, coupled with lower maternal activity in late gestation were associated with higher birth weight, especially during winter. CONCLUSIONS: If causal, these observations indicate that complete exposure (16 weeks) to the winter season (harvest-time) in late gestation could increase birth weight by 90 g in poor farming communities in rural India, and the benefit would increase further by lowering maternal activity. Our results underscore the importance of considering seasonality in planning targeted intervention strategies in such settings.},

abstract = {The diagnostic accuracy of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scales for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were examined using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Three logistic regression models were estimated in an initial sample of 121 children with and without ADHD. These models were then tested in a cross-validation sample (N = 122) and among the 111 brothers and 108 sisters of the initial and cross-validation samples. In all four groups, the CBCL Attention Problems scale had the highest discriminating power for ADHD. Adding other scales did not increase the area under the curve of the ROC significantly. These findings suggest that the CBCL Attention Problems scale could serve as a rapid and useful screening instrument not only to help identify cases likely to meet criteria for ADHD in clinical settings but also to identify cases of ADHD among the siblings of children with ADHD.},

abstract = {I present an overview of two methods controversies that are central to analysis and inference: That surrounding causal modeling as reflected in the "causal inference" movement, and that surrounding null bias in statistical methods as applied to causal questions. Human factors have expanded what might otherwise have been narrow technical discussions into broad philosophical debates. There seem to be misconceptions about the requirements and capabilities of formal methods, especially in notions that certain assumptions or models (such as potential-outcome models) are necessary or sufficient for valid inference. I argue that, once these misconceptions are removed, most elements of the opposing views can be reconciled. The chief problem of causal inference then becomes one of how to teach sound use of formal methods (such as causal modeling, statistical inference, and sensitivity analysis), and how to apply them without generating the overconfidence and misinterpretations that have ruined so many statistical practices.},

When compared to chidlren whose mothers had weight gains of 22 to 32 pounds, two of the seven tests at 4 years of age were failed more often by children whose mothers lost weight during pregnancy.... Combining acetonuria with low weight gain or weight loss produced no consisten evidence of mental or motor impairments at any age.

The results suggested that, strictly in terms of behavioral covariation, conduct problems in children may best be conceptualized in terms of two orthogonal dimensions of behavior: (1) an overt/covert dimension and (2) a destructive/nondestructive dimension. The four quadrants created by the intersection of these two bipolar dimensions corresponded well to distinctions among norm-violating behaviors made by legal systems and previous diagnostic conceptualizations: oppositional, aggressive, property violations, and status offenses. The results of this meta-analysis were cross-validated in a clinic sample of 177 boys age 7–12. One major finding from the validation sample was a strong correspondence between empirically derived syndromes based on the meta-analysis and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed. rev., American Psychiatric Association, 1987) (DSM-III-R) definitions of conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. A second major finding from the validation study was that age of onset may be a critical variable in explaining the results of the meta-analysis.},

To investigate whether in utero exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDE), is associated with childhood physical growth, we took a novel statistical approach to analyze data from the CHAMACOS cohort study. To model heterogeneity in the growth patterns, we used a finite mixture model in combination with a data transformation to characterize body mass index (BMI) with four groups and estimated the association between exposure and group membership. In boys, higher maternal concentrations of DDT and DDE during pregnancy are associated with a BMI growth pattern that is stable until about age five followed by increased growth through age nine. In contrast, higher maternal DDT exposure during pregnancy is associated with a flat, relatively stable growth pattern in girls. This study suggests that in utero exposure to DDT and DDE may be associated with childhood BMI growth patterns, not just BMI level, and both the magnitude of exposure and sex may impact the relationship.},

abstract = {A hospital based, comprehensive approach to the prevention of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects that combines clinical assessment, community outreach, and epidemiologic knowledge to attack alcohol-related birth defects is described. The program includes training of clinicians and members of the community, baseline screening of suspected children, and alcohol consumption screening of pregnant women in prenatal clinics. The major, although not exclusive, focus of the program is on tertiary prevention undertaken with women defined as "high risk" for producing alcohol affected children. Of the 48 women referred to the program at the Tuba City, AZ, Indian Medical Center between January 1988 and July 1989, 39 (81 percent) became participants. Complete followup was possible on 31; 17 of them reported alcohol abstinence in July 1989, 18 months into the program. Of the 29 referred women who were pregnant at the time, 21 agreed to participate; of these, 19 (85.7 percent) were abstinent by the third trimester of pregnancy; 5 voluntarily accepted offers of contraceptive measures after the birth of their child.},

abstract = {Pregnant women who use drugs are more likely to receive little or no prenatal care. This study sought to understand how drug use and factors associated with drug use influence women's prenatal care use. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of low-income women using alcohol and drugs in a California county. Women using drugs attend and avoid prenatal care for reasons not connected to their drug use: concern for the health of their baby, social support, and extrinsic barriers such as health insurance and transportation. Drug use itself is a barrier for a few women. In addition to drug use, women experience multiple simultaneous risk factors. Both the drug use and the multiple simultaneous risk factors make resolving extrinsic barriers more difficult. Women also fear the effects of drug use on their baby's health and fear being reported to Child Protective Services, each of which influence women's prenatal care use. Increasing the number of pregnant women who use drugs who receive prenatal care requires systems-level rather than only individual-level changes. These changes require a paradigm shift to viewing drug use in context of the person and society and acceptance of responsibility for unintended consequences of public health bureaucratic procedures and messages about effects of drug use during pregnancy.},

(2) What are the correlates of school difficulty? (3) Are behavior problems associated with school difficulty when variables are controlled for these correlates? The analysis revealed that 34{\%} of very low birth weight children could be characterized as having school difficulty, compared with 20{\%} and 14{\%} of the other groups, respectively, and that they were more likely to have higher scores on the hyperactive subscale of the Behavior Problems Index. Although a broad array of sociodemographic factors correlated with school difficulty, very low birth weight and hyperactivity scores contributed independently to the risk of academic problems. We conclude that very low birth weight infants are at risk of having school problems that are in part associated with hyperactive behavior.},

abstract = {Malaria is one of the most common and preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. In Africa, important progress has been made in the past decade with the introduction of a preventive strategy for malaria in pregnancy consisting of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated nets, yet their coverage is still unacceptably low and malaria continues to demand a huge toll on pregnant women and their newborn babies. Increasing the frequency of dosing of IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine might provide temporary respite, but increasing resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine makes research into safe, efficacious, and affordable alternatives for IPTp one of the  highest priorities for the control of malaria in pregnancy. A number of promising alternatives are, or will soon be, available that need to be evaluated as IPTp after their safety and pharmacokinetics in pregnancy have first been assessed in  parasitaemic women. Little is known about appropriate control strategies in Asia  and Latin America for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria in pregnancy, which in most countries rely on responsive case management approaches. The role of case management based on proactive screening for malaria infection of women attending antenatal care or preventive approaches with insecticide-treated  nets or IPTp are urgently needed. To achieve these objectives, multicentre and multidisciplinary approaches are required across the range of malaria transmission settings that include assessment of immunological effect of successful preventions, the perceptions and acceptability of different preventive approaches, and their cost-effectiveness.},

@article{Greenland1995,
abstract = {Epidemiologic studies often encounter missing covariate values. While simple methods such as stratification on missing-data status, conditional-mean imputation, and complete-subject analysis are commonly employed for handling this problem, several studies have shown that these methods can be biased under reasonable circumstances. The authors review these results in the context of logistic regression and present simulation experiments showing the limitations of the methods. The method based on missing-data indicators can exhibit severe bias even when the data are missing completely at random, and regression (conditional-mean) imputation can be inordinately sensitive to model misspecification. Even complete-subject analysis can outperform these methods. More sophisticated methods, such as maximum likelihood, multiple imputation, and weighted estimating equations, have been given extensive attention in the statistics literature. While these methods are superior to simple methods, they are not commonly used in epidemiology, no doubt due to their complexity and the lack of packaged software to apply these methods. The authors contrast the results of multiple imputation to simple methods in the analysis of a case-control study of endometrial cancer, and they find a meaningful difference in results for age at menarche. In general, the authors recommend that epidemiologists avoid using the missing-indicator method and use more sophisticated methods whenever a large proportion of data are missing.},

Such a design allows a sufficient number of cases to be obtained without extensive sampling and can increase efficiency; however, these case-control samples are then biased since the proportion of cases in the sample is not the same as the population of interest. Methods for analyzing case-control studies have focused on utilizing logistic regression models that provide conditional and not causal estimates of the odds ratio. This article will demonstrate the use of the prevalence probability and case-control weighted targeted maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), as described by van der Laan (2008), in order to obtain causal estimates of the parameters of interest (risk difference, relative risk, and odds ratio). It is meant to be used as a guide for researchers, with step-by-step directions to implement this methodology. We will also present simulation studies that show the improved efficiency of the case-control weighted targeted MLE compared to other techniques.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of ultrasonographically detected cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) in preterm twins at birth in relation to chorionicity, discordant weight and twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Methods: In this retrospective study, perinatal, neonatal, and cranial scan data of 85 monochorionic (MC) and 94 dichorionic (DC) twin pregnancies (341 infants) delivered between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation were collected. Data were analysed according to chorionicity, discordant birth weight ({\textgreater}20{\%}), single intrauterine death and TTTS. Results: The cerebral WML was seen in 14{\%} of preterm twins. Monochorionic infants had higher risks of WML than DC twin (odds ratio 7.1; 95{\%} CI 3.28-15.8). In MC group, discordant weight (37{\%}), TTTS (38{\%}), single intrauterine death (67{\%}) had higher incidence of cerebral WML than concordant weight infants (7{\%}). Similarly, incidence of WML was higher in DC discordant compared with concordant weight infants (13{\%} versus 2{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: Monochorionic infants had a seven-fold higher incidence of cerebral WML than DC infants.

abstract = {Assessing whether the effect of exposure on an outcome is completely mediated by a third variable is often done by conditioning on the intermediate variable. However, when an association remains, it is not always clear how this should be interpreted. It may be explained by a causal direct effect of the exposure on the disease, or the adjustment may have been distorted due to various reasons, such as error in the measured mediator or unknown confounding of association between the mediator and the outcome.In this paper, we study various situations where the conditional relationship between the exposure and the outcome is biased due to different types of measurement error in the mediator. For each of these situations, we quantify the effect on the association parameter. Such formulas can be used as tools for sensitivity analysis or to correct the association parameter for the bias due to measurement error. The performance of the bias formulas is studied by simulation and by applying them to data from a case-control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. In this study, the question was the extent to which the relationship between blood group and venous thrombosis might be mediated through coagulation factor VIII. We found that measurement error could have strongly biased the estimated direct effect of blood group on thrombosis. The formulas we propose can be a guide for researchers who find a residual association after adjusting for an intermediate variable and who wish to explore other possible explanations before concluding that there is a direct causal effect.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider mediation analysis when exposures and mediators vary over time. We give non-parametric identification results, discuss parametric im- plementation, and also provide a weighting approach to direct and indirect effects based on combining the results of two marginal structural models. We also discuss how our results give rise to a causal interpretation of the effect estimates produced from longitudinal structural equation models. When there are no time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure and mediator values, identification of di- rect and indirect effects is achieved by a longitudinal version of Pearl's mediation formula. When there are time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure and mediator, natural direct and indirect effects are not identified. We define a randomized interventional analogue of natural direct and indirect effects that are identified in this setting. The formula that identifies these effects we refer to as the “mediational g-formula.” When there is no mediation, the mediational g-formula reduces to Robins' regular g-formula for longitudinal data. When there are no time-varying confouders affected by prior exposure and mediator values, then the mediational g-formula reduces to a longitudinal version of Pearl's mediation for- mula. However, the mediational g-formula itself can accomodate both mediation and time-varying confounders.},

abstract = {Identification of new molecular targets for the treatment of breast cancer is an important clinical goal, especially for triple-negative breast cancer, which is refractory to existing targeted treatments. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor known primarily as the mediator of dioxin toxicity. However, the AhR can also inhibit cellular proliferation in a ligand-dependent manner and act as a tumor suppressor in mice, and thus may be a potential anticancer target. To investigate the AhR as an anticancer target, we conducted a small molecule screen to discover novel AhR ligands with anticancer properties. We identified raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator currently used in the clinic for prevention of ER-positive breast cancer and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, as an AhR activator. Raloxifene directly bound the AhR and induced apoptosis in ER-negative mouse and human hepatoma cells in an AhR-dependent manner, indicating that the AhR is a molecular target of raloxifene and mediates raloxifene-induced apoptosis in the absence of ER. Raloxifene selectively induced apoptosis of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared with non-transformed mammary epithelial cells via the AhR. Combined with recent data showing that raloxifene inhibits triple-negative breast cancer xenografts in vivo (Int J Oncol. 43(3):785-92, 2013), our results support the possibility of repurposing of raloxifene as an AhR-targeted therapeutic for triple-negative breast cancer patients. To this end, we also evaluated the role of AhR expression on survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. We found that higher expression of the AhR is significantly associated with increased overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in both hormone-dependent (ER-positive) and hormone-independent (ER and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative) breast cancers. Together, our data strongly support the possibility of using the AhR as a molecular target for the treatment of hormone-independent breast cancers.},

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review of a de-identified patient data. The current study extends our observations through the end of 2007 to 2015. RESULTS During the study period (1 January 1997 to 12 December 2015), there were 1 158 755 total discharges; 6023 (5.2/1000) had gastroschisis and 1885 (1.6/1000) had an omphalocele. Between 1997 and 2008, the reported rate of gastroschisis increased from 2.9 to 6.4/1000 discharges. From 2008 to 2011, the values have slowly decreased from 6.4 to 4.7/1000 discharges and since 2011 have been stable. The largest drop in the prevalence was in mothers who were {\textless}20 years old. In contrast, the reported rate of omphalocele was stable at 1 to 2/1000 discharges. CONCLUSION The prevalence of gastroschisis increased from 1997 to 2008, and then declined thereafter.},

abstract = {Definition of small for gestational age in various populations worldwide remains a challenge. References based on birthweight are deficient for preterm births, those derived from ultrasound estimates might not be applicable to all populations, and the individualised reference can be too complex to use in developing countries. Our aim was to create a generic reference for fetal weight and birthweight that overcame these deficiencies and could be readily adapted to local populations. We used the fetal-weight reference developed by Hadlock and colleagues and the notion of proportionality proposed by Gardosi and colleagues and made the weight reference easily adjustable according to the mean birthweight at 40 weeks of gestation for any local population. For application and validation, we used data from 24 countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia that participated in the 2004-08 WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health (237 025 births). We compared our reference with that of Hadlock and colleagues (non-customised) and with that of Gardosi and colleagues (individualised). For every reference, the odds ratio (OR) of adverse perinatal outcomes (stillbirths, neonatal deaths, referral to higher-level or special care unit, or Apgar score lower than 7 at 5 min) for infants who were small for gestational age versus those who were not was estimated with multilevel logistic regression. OR of adverse outcomes for infants small for gestational age versus those not small for gestational age was 1{\textperiodcentered}59 (95 CI 1{\textperiodcentered}53- 1{\textperiodcentered}66) for the non-customised fetal-weight reference compared with 2{\textperiodcentered}87 (2{\textperiodcentered}73-3{\textperiodcentered}01) for our country-specific reference, and 2{\textperiodcentered}84 (2{\textperiodcentered}71-2{\textperiodcentered}99) for the fully individualised reference. Our generic reference for fetal-weight and birthweight percentiles can be easily adapted to local populations. It has a better ability to predict adverse perinatal outcomes than has the non-customised fetal-weight reference, and is simpler to use than the individualised reference without loss of predictive ability.

"Children of mothers with a victimization history had higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Behavior problems identified at age 4 persist to age 8, suggesting that these problems are enduring. In contrast to the maternal report, there were no differences between children of victimized and nonvictimized mothers based on the teacher report of behavior problems nor in the children's cognitive development or academic achievement"
"trend noted for children of victimized mothers to report higher levels of anger than children of nonvictimized mothers do."
"maternal social support was found to be a mediator of victimization on externalizing behavior problems and lack of socialization skills. Maternal depressive symptoms, however, were found to mediate victimization on internalizing behavior problems as well as lack of socialization skills with a partially mediated relationship for externalizing behavior problems.... the mediation effects of social support on externalizing and socialization skills were more robust, as were the mediation effects of maternal depressive symptoms on both internalizing and socialization skills."
"The current study builds on a previous longitudinal investigation of the same sample of children at ages 4 and 6 (cite). The previous study found that children of victimized mothers had significantly more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems based on maternal report, compared to children of nonvictimized mothers. Maternal vicitmization history was not related to teachers' ratings of children's behavior, child reports of social competence and depressive symptoms, or standardized assessments of cognitive behavior."
"Although there is a suggestive link between mothers' childhood victimization histories and their children's behavior problems, the pathway by which this occurs is somewhat unclear. Some studies suggest that mothers' childhood victimization negatively affects their parenting capacity. This argument is supported by findings that parents who experienced sexual abuse as children report less knowledge and confidence in parenting skills, have more negative views of themselves as parents, use physical punishment strategies more often, and report more lack of control in parenting situations, compared to nonabused parents (all cited). Zuravin and DiBlasio (1992) reported that a history of child sexual abuse distinguished adolescent mothers who had neglected their children from those who had not. Mothers who were physically abused as children have more hostile-intrusive behavior toward their infants than nonabused parents do. However, investigators who have examined abused parents' views of their childhood experiences or current life stress and distress suggest that depressive symptoms or limited social supports may mediate the relationship between a history of childhood abuse and current parenting behavior."
effects: "psychological, behavioral, and social difficulties that range from depressive symptoms and low self-esteem to substance abuse and personality disorders. Depressive symptoms and lack of social support are the most common long-term sequelae. The low levels of social support among adult survivors of child sexual and physical abuse and among victims or domestic violence suggest that the mechanism through which victimization history negatively affects adult functioning is through a lack of social support."
depression
"Social support influences children's cognitive and social development by enabling parents to use developmentally appropriate parenting skills and alleviating parental stress.... Mothers who feel supported by others are more likely to view their children as having fewer behavior problems."
"The finding that, when using a stringent test of mediation, maternal depressive symptoms do not mediate maternal report of externalizing behavior is of importance. This finding suggests that maternal depressive symptoms do not simply result in mothers viewing their children globally as problematic but, rather, that they discriminate between types of behavior problems."},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Background: The literature theorizes, but does not test, that variation over time in selective loss in utero affects the observed count of live-born birth defects cases. We test the hypothesis that the risk of birth defects among live-born males varies inversely with the strength of selection against males in utero. Methods: We identified a subset of six birth defect phenotypes among males from the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, an active surveillance system for over 490,000 male singletons born in eight California counties from 1986 to 2004. We assigned each birth defect case infant to a monthly conception cohort at risk of selection in utero. We used the monthly sex ratio at birth (M:F), derived from each conception cohort, as the indicator of selection against males. We analyzed the odds ratio of birth defects with both individual-level logistic regression and aggregate time-series methods. Results: Consistent with selection in utero, male infants from conception cohorts with low outlying sex ratios (i.e., stronger selectivity) exhibit fewer than expected birth defects (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.86; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]  = 0.76, 0.98). Aggregate time-series tests also yield similar findings (OR = 0.81; 95{\%} CI = 0.71, 0.90). Conclusions: Our findings among males indicate that variation in the strength of selectivity in utero accounts for a portion of observed cohort differences in morbidity due to birth defects. These findings suggest that "revealed prevalence" of morbidity across birth cohorts varies, at least in part, from selective loss in utero. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B209.},

The vast majority (96{\%}) of articles that report P values in the abstract, full text, or both include some values of .05 or less.1 However, many of the claims that these reports highlight are likely false.2 Recognizing the major importance of the statistical significance conundrum, the American Statistical Association (ASA) published3 a statement on P values in 2016. The status quo is widely believed to be problematic, but how exactly to fix the problem is far more contentious. The contributors to the ASA statement also wrote 20 independent, accompanying commentaries focusing on different aspects and prioritizing different solutions. Another large coalition of 72 methodologists recently proposed4 a specific, simple move: lowering the routine P value threshold for claiming statistical significance from .05 to .005 for new discoveries. The proposal met with strong endorsement in some circles and concerns in others.},

abstract = {Definition of small for gestational age in various populations worldwide remains a challenge. References based on birthweight are deficient for preterm births, those derived from ultrasound estimates might not be applicable to all populations, and the individualised reference can be too complex to use in developing countries. Our aim was to create a generic reference for fetal weight and birthweight that overcame these deficiencies and could be readily adapted to local populations. We used the fetal-weight reference developed by Hadlock and colleagues and the notion of proportionality proposed by Gardosi and colleagues and made the weight reference easily adjustable according to the mean birthweight at 40 weeks of gestation for any local population. For application and validation, we used data from 24 countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia that participated in the 2004-08 WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health (237 025 births). We compared our reference with that of Hadlock and colleagues (non-customised) and with that of Gardosi and colleagues (individualised). For every reference, the odds ratio (OR) of adverse perinatal outcomes (stillbirths, neonatal deaths, referral to higher-level or special care unit, or Apgar score lower than 7 at 5 min) for infants who were small for gestational age versus those who were not was estimated with multilevel logistic regression. OR of adverse outcomes for infants small for gestational age versus those not small for gestational age was 1{\textperiodcentered}59 (95 CI 1{\textperiodcentered}53- 1{\textperiodcentered}66) for the non-customised fetal-weight reference compared with 2{\textperiodcentered}87 (2{\textperiodcentered}73-3{\textperiodcentered}01) for our country-specific reference, and 2{\textperiodcentered}84 (2{\textperiodcentered}71-2{\textperiodcentered}99) for the fully individualised reference. Our generic reference for fetal-weight and birthweight percentiles can be easily adapted to local populations. It has a better ability to predict adverse perinatal outcomes than has the non-customised fetal-weight reference, and is simpler to use than the individualised reference without loss of predictive ability.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The strong inverse association between maternal age and risk of gastroschisis in offspring has spurred many investigators to hypothesize that behaviors among younger females are the cause. Examples include cigarette smoking, illicit drugs, genitourinary infections, and sexually transmitted diseases, each of which has been reported to be associated with gastroschisis. Although these exposures are more common in young women, recent studies have shown that cigarette smoking, genitourinary infections, and sexually transmitted diseases are most strongly associated with gastroschisis in older women. There is both anecdotal and published evidence showing that gastroschisis sometimes (but not always) occurs in clusters, raising the possibility that an infectious agent might be involved in its pathogenesis.RESULTS:One such agent whose epidemiologic characteristics parallel those of gastroschisis is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Primary EBV infection in early childhood has been decreasing over time, leaving a greater proportion of adolescents at risk, as reflected by increased rates of infectious mononucleosis over time. During the childbearing years, risk of primary EBV infection decreases dramatically, as does risk of gastroschisis. The stronger risks of gastroschisis associated with cigarette smoking, genitourinary infections, and sexually transmitted diseases in older women might be explained by EBV reactivation resulting from multiple challenges to immune response such as pregnancy, age, toxic exposures, and genitourinary and sexually transmitted infections.CONCLUSION:EBV and other herpes viruses should be added to the research agenda for gastroschisis.

abstract = {Objectives: 
To present national population-based estimates of the prevalence of parent-reported emotional and/or behavioral problems in children with asthma and the relationship of medical comorbidity and asthma severity with behavior problems.Design:
Cross-sectional study of the 1988 National Health Interview on Child Health.Main Outcome Measures:
Parent responses to a checklist of child health conditions were used to assign school-age children (5 to 17 years old) into one of four groups: children without reported chronic conditions; children with asthma alone; children with asthma and additional reported chronic conditions; and children with the same chronic conditions, but without asthma. Parental responses to the Behavior Problem Index (BPI) were used for construction of an overall BPI score, as well as subscale scores. Crosstabulation and linear and logistic regression were used to determine the relation of the different condition categories to emotional and/or behavioral problems expressed by relative values of the BPI.Results:
Children with asthma and comorbid conditions had a mean BPI score of 7.3, compared with 5.4 for children without chronic conditions, and all subscale scores, except those for antisocial antisocial conduct and immature behavior, were significantly elevated. Using logistic regression to control for confounding variables, children with severe asthma alone had nearly three times the odds (odds ratio, 2.96; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.22 to 7.17) and children with asthma plus comorbid conditions nearly twice the odds (odds ratio, 1.86; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.90) of children without chronic conditions to have severe behavior problems.Conclusions:
Severe asthma and asthma with medical comorbidity represent significant risk factors for emotional and/or behavioral problems. Clinicians caring for children with asthma and their families should be aware of the relationship between asthma and emotional and/or behavioral problems and anticipate that a substantial number of their patients may have mental health services needs.(Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1995;149:565-572)},

"Each score reflects the sum of problem behaviors reported by the caregiver.... The internal consistency reliability was 0.85 of the 5-11 year old group... The psychometric properties of the BPI have been described in more detail elsewhere (32,33)... (use in 35-38) To allow for the identification of children with severe behavior scores, we created a dichotomous variable, separating children at or above the 90th percentile of the BPI distribution, ie, a parent had identified more than 14 problem behaviors."

The statistical analysis was based on the logistic regression model using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The Bayesian approach was used to determine the posterior probability (posterior Pr[odds ratio {\{}OR{\}} {\textgreater} 1]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results showed absence for at least 1 MMR protein in 25{\%} of the cases, 15{\%} for hMLH1, and 10{\%} for hMSH2.

The MLE demonstrated that women diagnosed with EC before the age of 50 (OR: 12.4; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-322.7), having FHC related to LS (OR: 17.7; 95{\%} CI = 0.6-534.6), and having lower BMI (OR: 2.38; 95{\%} CI = 0.39-14.28) present higher odds than their counterparts of lacking an MMR protein, once adjusted for potential predictors (P {\textgreater} 0.05).

The study was conducted to assess and compare intelligence quotient of children living in high and low fluoride areas in Kutch, Gujarat, India. METHODS A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted among 100 school children aged 8 to 10 years, living in Kutch District, Gujarat, India during July 2012. Mundra (2.4 to 3.5 mg/L) and Bhuj (0.5mg/L) were the two villages randomly selected to represent the high and low water fluoride areas respectively. Seguin Form Board Test was used to assess the intelligence quotient (IQ) level of children. Descriptive statistics and independent sample t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS Mean scores for average, shortest and total timing category were found to be significantly higher (P{\textless}0.05) among children living in Mundra (30.45±4.97) than those living in Bhuj (23.20±6.21). Mean differences at 95{\%} confidence interval for these timings were found to be 7.24, 7.28 and 21.78 respectively. In both the villages, females had lower mean timing scores than males but the difference was not statistically significant (P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSION Chronic exposure to high levels of fluoride in water was observed to be associated with lower intelligence quotient.},

We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a United Kingdom prospective cohort (1990 through the present) with a median of 10 maternal weight measurements in pregnancy. These were used to allocate participants to 2009 Institute of Medicine weight-gain categories and in random effect linear spline models. Outcomes were School Entry Assessment score (age, 4 years; n = 5,832), standardized intelligence quotient assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (age, 8 years; n = 5,191), and school final-examination results (age, 16 years; n = 7,339). Offspring of women who gained less weight than recommended had a 0.075 standard deviation lower mean School Entry Assessment score (95{\%} confidence interval: -0.127, -0.023) and were less likely to achieve adequate final-examination results (odds ratio = 0.88, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.78, 0.99) compared with offspring of women who gained as recommended. GWG in early pregnancy (defined as 0-18 weeks on the basis of a knot point at 18 weeks) and midpregnancy (defined as 18-28 weeks on the basis of knot points at 18 and 28 weeks) was positively associated with School Entry Assessment score and intelligence quotient. GWG in late pregnancy (defined as 28 weeks onward on the basis of a knot point at 28 weeks) was positively associated with offspring intelligence quotient and with increased odds of offspring achieving adequate final-examination results in mothers who were overweight prepregnancy. Findings support small positive associations between GWG and offspring cognitive development, which may have lasting effects on educational attainment up to age 16 years.},

We then show how one can estimate this effect under these conditions using the g-computation algorithm of Robins. We also derive the conditions under which some current approaches to the analysis of longitudinal data, such as the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach of Zeger and Liang, the feedback model techniques of Liang and Zeger, and within-subject conditional methods, can provide valid tests and estimates of causal effects. We use our methods to estimate the causal effect of maternal stress on the marginal probability of a child's illness from the Mothers' Stress and Children's Morbidity data and compare our results with those previously obtained by Zeger and Liang using a GEE approach.},

abstract = {The last few decades have seen the Structural Causal Model framework provide valuable tools to assess causal effects from observational data. In this article, we briefly review recent results regarding the recoverability of causal effects from selection biased data, and apply them to the case of responsibility analyses in road safety epidemiology. Our objective is to formally determine which effects can be unbiasedly estimated through this type of analyses, depending on available data. We consider the estimation of the causal effect of alcohol in two situations. First, when data are available for all types of crashes, we show that the causal odds-ratio of alcohol on the responsibility to trigger a car accident can be approximated under some assumptions. However, available data most often depends on the accident severity, which is related to speed. In this case, the causal odds-ratio of alcohol is not recoverable. We present numerical results to illustrate our arguments and the magnitude of the bias. We finally show that this bias makes association measures not only externally, but also internally invalid.},

Participants ranged in age from 14 to 36 years, with a mean of 20 years. Exposure to childhood emotional and physical abuse was associated with 6-month parenting behavior; but not parenting knowledge. Teen mothers, as opposed to adult mothers, had higher mean scores for exposure to childhood emotional and physical abuse. Adult high resource mothers reported lower mean scores on each abuse outcome than both teen and adult low resource mothers. For the total sample of mothers, as past exposure to emotional and physical abuse increased, maternal responsivity decreased, and opinions towards, and propensities for, abusive behavior increased.},
annote = {first-time mothers, recruited during pregnancies in four US communities -- teens and ethnically matched adult sample
 
"A history of physical abuse is associated with punitive parenting style and discipline practices (numerous citations)"
"Examinations of past childhood experiences combined with examinations of reported opinions and behaviors aid in clarifying mechanisms involved in strategies parents use when raising their children."
"It is estimated that up to one third of the variance predicting child maltreatment is accounted for by maternal history of abuse (cite). It has been shown that mothers who had experienced some form of abuse during their lifetime were more likely to engage in negative responses and abusive behavior toward their children than mothers who did not experience abuse (numerous cites)"
"In particular, Langeland and Dijkstra's (1995) review of the literature found that rates of transmission of intergenerational child abuse varied by the researchers definition of abuse, whether the individuals were abused by one or both parents, and whether or not parents had access to supportive relationships. These authors reported wide variations in rates of intergenerational transmission of abuse (7-56{\%} in retrospective studies, and 3-70{\%} in prospective studies)."
"it may be that mothers who have been abused have a lower threshold for reacting to their children's misbehavior, which in turn, leads to the use of harsh discipline. This reactive propensity creates a situation in which even minor infractions are likely to set off a series of negative mother-child interactions." (good paragraph about transmission here)
young mothers -- worse parenting skills
asked six months postpartum about physical, emotional, and sexual abuse when growing up
also assessed parenting knowledge and parenting behavior
"multiple regression analyses were used to examine the predictive relationships between maternal history of emotional and physical abuse and parenting knowledge and behavior 6 months after the birth of their first child."
"Childhood exposure to sexual abuse was not significantly related to any outcome variable"
"mean emotional...physical abuse scores for teen mothers [were] significantly different from those of adult high resource mothers. Mothers did not differ in their mean reports of exposure to childhood sexual abuse"
"Physical abuse did not predict 6-month parenting outcomes for teen and adult low resource mothers. However, childhood exposure to physical abuse predicted 6-month parenting outcomes for adult high resource mothers. More specifically, physical abuse accounted for a significant proportion of the variance found among adult high resource mother's responsitivity/empathy scores, punishment scores, and moderately predicted authoritarian parenting scores. Physical abuse also accounted for a significant proportion of the variance found among adult high resource mother's propensities to engage in abusic behavior. As exposure to physical abuse increased, maternal responsitivity decreased; whereas propensities for abuse behavior increased." (basically same for total sample0},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the association of maternal stressful life events and social support with risks of birth defects using National Birth Defects Prevention Study data, a population-based case-control study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We examined seven stressful life events and three social support questions applicable to the periconceptional period, among mothers of 552 cases with neural tube defects (NTDs), 413 cleft palate (CP), 797 cleft lip ± cleft palate (CLP), 189 d-transposition of the great arteries (dTGA), 311 tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and 2974 non-malformed controls. A stressful life events index equalled the sum of 'yes' responses to the seven questions. Social support questions were also summed to form an index. Data were analyzed using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for maternal race-ethnicity, age, education, body mass index, smoking, drinking, and intake of vitamin supplements.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Associations with the stress index tended to be higher with higher scores, but few 95{\%} CIs excluded one. A four-point increase in the index was moderately associated with NTDs (OR 1.5, [95{\%} CI 1.1, 2.0]) and CLP (OR 1.3, [95{\%} CI 1.0, 1.7]). The social support index tended to be associated with reduced risk but most 95{\%} CIs included one, with the exception of dTGA (OR for a score of 3 vs 0 was 0.5 [95{\%} CI 0.3, 0.8]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Maternal periconceptional stressful life events, social support, and the two factors in combination were at most modestly, if at all, associated with risks of the studied birth defects.},

abstract = {Hypertensive pregnancy disorders may affect the fetal developmental milieu and thus hint at mechanisms that link prenatal conditions with later developmental outcomes of the offspring. Here, we systematically review studies that have tested whether maternal pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and hypertensive pregnancy disorders as a single diagnostic entity are associated with cognitive functioning of the offspring. Twenty-six studies were eligible for this review. Of them, 19 provided detailed methodological information deemed necessary to be included for a more detailed review. An overall conclusion is that, in the general population, maternal hypertensive disorders may be associated with lower cognitive ability of the offspring. Studies that extend to adulthood show the most consistent pattern of findings. It is possible that the associations arise during the lifetime or that the findings reflect improvements in management of these disorders. Evidence is, however, insufficient to conclude whether these associations are dissimilar in the offspring exposed to maternal pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, due to the varied criteria used across the different studies to distinguish between these conditions. The existing studies also vary in the definition of control groups, and very few have taken into account important confounding factors, including maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and lifestyle behaviors. Given the mixed pattern of findings and limitations related to internal and external validity, further studies are clearly warranted to clarify the associations.},

abstract = {ISSUES: The lack of consensus about whether low to moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are a risk factor for fetal development has generated considerable debate about what advice policies and guidelines should provide. APPROACH: This paper reviews the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining the risk from low and moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure, along with the results of articles published 2009-2010, after the reviews. KEY FINDINGS: The reported significant effects from low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are likely due to methodological issues such as confounding and/or misclassification of exposure or outcome and there is no strong research evidence of fetal effects from low levels of alcohol exposure. However, harm is well-documented with heavy exposure and moderate levels of exposure, 30-40 g per occasion and no more than 70 g per week, have been demonstrated to increase the risk of child behaviour problems. IMPLICATIONS: With such a small margin before there is increased risk to the fetus, it would be morally and ethically unacceptable for policies and guidelines to condone consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Not all women will follow this advice and some women will inadvertently consume alcohol prior to pregnancy awareness requiring non-judgmental counselling and the provision of rational advice about the likelihood of risk to the fetus. CONCLUSIONS: The policy advice that 'the safest choice for pregnant women is to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy' should be maintained. However, the abstinence message needs to be presented in a balanced and rational manner to prevent unintended negative consequences.},

prepregnancy obesity independently associated with an increase in the BPI total scores among whites only; similar trends with internalizing and externalizing subscores

"Among the White sample, children born to obese women were more socially disadvantaged that those born to non-obese women, whereas no such trend was observed in children of African American obese and non-obese women"

2, 3 -- intrauterine environment on the central nervous system

6-8 maternal prepregnancy obesity and offspring cognition

13,14 animal studies of maternal prepregnancy obesity, memory and learning of young mice (inflammatory markers in the brain)

15,16 -- ADHD in obese vs. normal weight Nordic women

17 -- "no consistent associations between prepregnancy overweight/obesity and behavior problem scores at preschool age or at primary school age across the cohorts."

"If maternal prepregnancy obesity adversely influences children's behavioral development purely through a pathway involving obesity-related metabolic mechanisms during intrauterine period, one would expect the association between prepregnancy obesity and a measure representing children's behavior to demonstrate a similar trend regardless of racial differences"

only used term, 2005+g children

19, 20, 21 -- BPI info

"Mothers rated scores on 28 questions, which were based on their children's behavior exhibited for the past three months."

covariates -- prenatal factors (birthweight, gestational age, smoking during pregnancy (dichotomous)), maternal factors (maternal age, education (years completed), AFQT score percentile), home background factors (HOME emotional support subscale -- mean of all standardized scores across birth-119 months, household per capita income (average across observation period), marital status (percent time mother married with spouse present)), child factors (race, gender, birth order, child's age in months, child's weight status at BPI assessment)

only kept maternal education in model, not AFQT score, due to high correlation

no BMI categories association with problem behavior scores using whole cohort, but interaction for race/obesity significant

white mothers: marginally significant overweight, in unadjusted models, underweight association positively -- including maternal age and smoking attenuated. "On the other hand, among African American childre, prepregnancy obesity was not only a non-significant factor for the BPI total scores but also the direction of the coefficient was opposite from that of Whites. Neither maternal prepregnancy overweight nor underweight was associated with children's BPI total scores. Interestingly, only the coefficient for maternal prepregnancy underweight bore a positive sign."

"contemporaneous maternal obesity was not an independent factor for children's BPI scores in either racial group, suggesting that the timing for a White woman's being obese may play an important role in the association."

"wide social gap between obese and non-obese women seemed to exist among Whites but not among African-Americans."

"Replication of the study using African American children form a different cohort is warranted to verify our findings."

"Our results indicate that the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and children's behavior problems may be largely due to disadvantaged social characteristics that are uniquely present among White female population."},

abstract = {The mediation formula for the identification of natural (in)direct effects has facilitated mediation analyses that better respect the nature of the data, with greater consideration of the need for confounding control. The default assumptions on which it relies are strong, however. In particular, they are known to be violated when confounders of the mediator-outcome association are affected by the exposure. This complicates extensions of counterfactual-based mediation analysis to settings that involve repeatedly measured mediators, or multiple correlated mediators. VanderWeele, Vansteelandt, and Robins introduced so-called interventional (in)direct effects. These can be identified under much weaker conditions than natural (in)direct effects, but have the drawback of not adding up to the total effect. In this article, we adapt their proposal to achieve an exact decomposition of the total effect, and extend it to the multiple mediator setting. Interestingly, the proposed effects capture the path-specific effects of an exposure on an outcome that are mediated by distinct mediators, even when-as often-the structural dependence between the multiple mediators is unknown, for instance, when the direction of the causal effects between the mediators is unknown, or there may be unmeasured common causes of the mediators.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are some indications that maternal lifestyle during pregnancy (smoking and stress) contributes to symptoms of ADHD in children. We prospectively studied whether prenatal exposure to maternal smoking and/or stress is associated with ADHD symptoms and diagnostic criteria (according to DSM-IV) in 7-year-olds. METHODS: Nulliparous Scandinavian women were consecutively recruited at their first prenatal health care visit and assessments of smoking and stress were collected at gestational weeks 10, 12, 20, 28, 32, and 36. Children were followed up at 7 years old. We obtained full data for 72{\%} of the sample: ADHD symptoms were rated by 74{\%} of mothers (n=290) and 96{\%} of eligible teachers (n=208). Attrition analyses showed no differences on key variables between participants and non-participants at follow-up. RESULTS: Results of multiple regression analyses showed prenatal exposure to smoking (beta=.16, p{\textless}.01) and stress (beta=.18, p{\textless}.01) were independently associated with later symptoms of ADHD. Results of logistic regression analyses showed that fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria for ADHD was related to exposure to prenatal stress (beta=.68, p{\textless}.01) especially in boys. The results were not confounded by sociodemographic factors or birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that prenatal exposure to stress and smoking is independently associated with later symptoms of ADHD in human children, particularly for boys. Because stress and smoking are relatively common during pregnancy, and yet preventable, these results are of public health significance.},

abstract = {Generalizing empirical findings to new environments, settings, or populations is essential in most scientific explorations. This article treats a particular problem of generalizability, called "transportability", defined as a license to transfer information learned in experimental studies to a different population, on which only observational studies can be conducted. Given a set of assumptions concerning commonalities and differences between the two populations, Pearl and Bareinboim (2011) derived sufficient conditions that permit such transfer to take place. This article summarizes their findings and supplements them with an effective procedure for deciding when and how transportability is feasible. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target population are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments. The article further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of combining observational and experimental information to synthesize bias-free estimate of the desired causal relation. Finally, the article examines the differences between transportability and other variants of generalizability.},

abstract = {In utero exposure to alcohol can have numerous adverse effects on a developing fetus. These effects represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities that have recently been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children at the most severe end of this spectrum and displaying the complete phenotype of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system are defined as having fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). While FAS is the most readily clinically recognized form of FASD, other categories within the continuum of adverse effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure are becoming better defined. These include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). As more is learned regarding the exact manifestations of alcohol on brain development, these classifications may be expanded and/or refined. Because FASD represents a major public health concern, early recognition of at-risk children is important for initiating interventional strategies. Thus, the purpose of this report is to educate practicing physicians about the recognizable phenotypes of FASD in order to accurately identify these children and implement the most appropriate management plans. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {M. McGue and D. T. Lykken (1992) found that divorce risk was, to a substantial degree, genetically mediated; prior research has identified numerous social and psychological factors that affect divorce risk (G. C. Kitson, K. B. Barbi, {\&} M. J. Roach, 1985). The present study attempted to link these domains by examining the extent to which genetic influences on one such psychological factor, per-sonality, explain divorce risk heritability. A sample of adult twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry completed a marital history questionnaire and the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (A. Tellegen, 1982). Positive Emotionality and Negative Emotionality factors were positively related to divorce risk, whereas Constraint was negatively related. In women and men, respectively, 30{\%} and 42{\%} of tlCe beritability of divorce risk consisted of genetic factors affecting personality and personal-ity and divorce risk correlated largely as a result of these common genetic influences. A substantial amount of research has been devoted to the study of divorce. Dozens of books and hundreds of scholarly articles have examined the cultural, sociological, and psycho-logical dynamics of this phenomenon. Recently, McGue and Lykken (1992) approached this topic from a different perspec-tive. Rather than attempting to describe the social circum-stances or personal attributes that contribute to the risk of di-vorce, they used a sample of twins to estimate the extent to which variation in divorce risk could be explained by the ge-netic factors contributed by one member of the marital union (i.e., the twin). Their findings were surprising: .53 {\_}+ .05 (+ SE)},

abstract = {Depressive symptomatology can proceed from altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortex (HPA)-axis function. Some authors stress the role that early life stress (ELS) may play in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. However, the involvement of the HPA-axis in linking prenatal ELS with depressive symptoms has not been tested in a prospective-longitudinal study extending until after puberty in humans. Therefore, we examined whether antenatal maternal anxiety is associated with disturbances in HPA-axis regulation and whether the HPA-axis dysregulation mediates the association between antenatal maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms in post-pubertal adolescents. As part of a prospective-longitudinal study, we investigated maternal anxiety at 12–22, 23–32, and 32–40 weeks of pregnancy (wp) with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In the 14–15-year-old offspring (n ¼ 58) HPA-axis function was measured through establishing a saliva cortisol day-time profile. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Children's Depression symptoms Inventory (CDI). Results of regression analyses showed that antenatal exposure to maternal anxiety at 12–22 wp was in both sexes associated with a high, flattened cortisol day-time profile (P ¼ 0.0463) which, in female adolescents only, was associated with depressive symptoms (P ¼ 0.0077). All effects remained after controlling for maternal smoking, birth weight, obstetrical optimality, maternal postnatal anxiety and puberty phase. Our prospective study demonstrates, for the first time, the involvement of the HPA-axis in the link between antenatal maternal anxiety/prenatal ELS and depressive symptoms for post-pubertal female adolescents.

used children who were 6-8 years old in 1986

"The items were reported by the motehrs who indicated whether each item was "often true" (3), "sometimes true" (2), or "not true" (1) of the child. We divided the items into two main groups: those that  reflect externalizing problems (manifestations of distress that are expressed in outward behavior, such as persisten disobedienceor physical aggression) and thoe that reflect internalizing problems (manifestations of distress that are expressed in inward feelsings, such as depression or moddiness) based on factor analysis of the 1986 items. The items for the two scales are listed in Appendiz Table 2. not all items loaded clearly on one factor of the otehr; the final two scales included a total of 22 itens. The reliabilities are .86 for externalizing problems and .72 for internalizing problems. We used simple summated scales in our analysis."

"Because each of the broad scales encompasses a variety of other specific constellations of problems, we replicated all of our analyses using pre-specified subscales for hyperactive behaviors, headstrong behaviors, antisocial behaviors, anxiety/depression, peer withdrawal, and dependency (as determined by NLSY staff). Those analyses did not provide any information of substance beyond what we report here. In addition, we wondered whether the effects of childhood emotional and behavioral problems might be stronger in the comparison of children with very serious problems than they are along the

@article{Jensen2000,
abstract = {Many studies have found decreased fecundability, that is, the ability to conceive in a menstrual cycle, with increasing female age. To evaluate the effect of maternal age on waiting time to pregnancy, the authors reviewed hospital charts of all pregnant women attending prophylactic antenatal care at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, during 1972-1987. Only the first pregnancy of each woman and only planned pregnancies were included (n = 14,754). The fecundability odds ratio (FR) was calculated as the odds of a conception in a menstrual cycle among the older women divided by the odds among women aged 15-24 years. The FR for women aged 25-29 years was 1.12 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.20), for women aged 30-34 years it was 1.15 (95{\%} CI: 1.01, 1.30), and for women above 34 years the FR was 2.44 (95{\%} CI: 1.84, 3.22) after adjustment for confounders. The increased fecundability with age is contrary to previous studies and may be explained by selection bias, as sterile women were not included. In addition, some very fertile young women who became pregnant by accident before efficient birth control methods were available and therefore were excluded from time to pregnancy studies may now use oral contraceptives until they plan a pregnancy later in life and are included.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test for a suspected adverse effect of low birth weight ({\textless} or = 2500 g) on IQ at age 6 years in two socioeconomically disparate populations. DESIGN: Nonconcurrent prospective study. SETTING: An urban, predominantly disadvantaged population and a suburban middle-class population in southeastern Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Low-birth-weight (N = 473) and normal-birth-weight (N = 350) subjects, randomly selected from the 1983 through the 1985 newborn lists of two major hospitals, one serving an urban and the other a suburban population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised to measure IQ. RESULTS: The mean full-scale IQ of low-birth-weight children was 4.9 points lower than that of normal-birth-weight children, controlling for population site, maternal IQ, maternal education, and race (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 6.8). There was no evidence of low-birth-weight interaction with population site, and the same IQ difference was detected in both populations. In the urban population, low birth weight was associated with an increased risk for IQ below 85 (odds ratio, 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 3.7). In the suburban population, low birth weight was associated with an increased risk for IQ below 100 (odds ratio, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.2 to 3.4). A gradient relationship with full-scale IQ was observed, with the largest deficit in those born weighing 1500 g or less, an intermediate deficit in those born weighing 1501 through 2000 g, and the least pronounced deficit in those born weighing 2001 through 2500 g. CONCLUSIONS: The overall effect of low birth weight represents an increase of approximately 10{\%} of low-birth-weight children with an IQ of more than 1 SD below the population's mean. Children born weighing 2000 g or less bore the major burden of the IQ deficits},

abstract = {Background: Obesity paradox refers to the commonly reported association between obesity and reduced mortality where obesity is a risk factor for selection into the population under investigation, for example a case-cohort within type 2 diabetes. A common explanation is collider stratification bias, which proposes that the obesity paradox is driven by unmeasured confounding induced by selection bias. Methods: Using a directed acyclic graph and regression models to characterise relationships between variables, we derive equations that give the extent of bias caused by collider stratification in a selected population using counterfactual causal analysis. We illustrate the bias for a range of parameter settings, describing different associations between the exposure (obesity), the outcome (mortality), the mediator (diabetes status) and an unmeasured confounder. Results: Collider stratification leads to biased estimation of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. However, the bias induced is small relative to the causal relationships between the variables. In particular, if there were a causal effect between the exposure and the outcome, the confounding would need to be at least three times stronger than this effect to observe an association between the exposure and outcome in the opposite direction. Conclusions: While collider bias can be a partial explanation of the obesity paradox, it is unlikely to explain an observed association between obesity and mortality in the reverse direction to a true causal relationship. Alternative explanations of the obesity paradox should continue to be explored.},

In a sample of 152 typically developing children aged between 3.6 and 6.6 years, we found evidence that suggests that inhibitory control is linked to age-related differences in intelligence. Stop-signal inhibition improved at a rate similar to the age-related changes in Verbal IQ. Components of variance analyses revealed that stop-signal reaction time predicted a larger proportion of the age-related variance in children's verbal intelligence than non-age-related variance.

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to clarify relationships among the distribution of birth month, maturation and body size in young soccer players. We therefore examined physical and maturational differences between selected players, who were considered to have higher potential to play soccer at a professional level as decided subjectively by coaches, and unselected players. Participants were 332 elite soccer players (mean age = 12.2 +/- 1.5 years; range = 9.1-15.0 years). Participants were divided into six categories (under = U10 to U15), depending on chronological age. Height, body mass skeletal age and maturation difference (skeletal age - chronological age) were compared among four groups (quarter = Q1 to Q4) depending on month of birth. Overall, the distribution of players across the four quarters was skewed such that numbers were greatest in Q1 and smallest in Q4. No significant differences in maturation difference were observed between birth quarters in any age category. On the other hand, except for the U14 age category, there were no significant differences in height between Q4 and Q1 players. However, the height of Q4 players was significantly smaller than those of Q1 in three (U11, U13 and U14, P {\textless} 0.01) of six categories when maturation difference was statistically controlled. Our results suggest a clear bias toward quarter of birth and this bias may depend to some extent on differences in individual skeletal age and body size. Individual biological maturation should thus be considered when selecting adolescent soccer players.},

A number of modified count data models allow us to estimate the effect of the reform in different parts of the distribution.

“using as outcome measure the individual number of visits to a doctor. Second, it makes the case that in situations such as the evaluation of health care reform, it is very important to entertain the possibility that the reform effect may differ in different parts of the distribution. Crucial information may thus get lost in single index models such as the Poisson or negative binomial models. {\ldots} hurdle models, among them a newly developed probit-Poisson-log-normal model, and finite fixture models offer additional flexibility{\ldots}. The effect is much larger in the lower part of the distribution (for the choice between having no visit or at least one visit) than in the upper part of the distribution (the number of visits given at least one visit).”


 

“A third potential criticism is the single index structure of the Poisson regression model (and its generalizations above), which implies that once the mean is given all other aspects of the distribution are determined as well. In particular, the reform cannot have different effects in different parts of the distribution (relative to the Poisson probability function).”

 

“The hurdle model combines a binary model for the decision of use with a truncated-at-one count data model for the extent of use given use.”

“The first contact decision is made independently by the patient, whereas the treatment and referral decisions are influenced by the physician.”

 

“probit-Poisson-log-normal model with correlated errors. This is an appealing possibility, since it relaxes the assumption of conditional independence between the hurdle step and the distribution model for strictly positive outcomes. This assumption is violated if common unobservables affect both parts of the model.},

abstract = {One approach to quantifying the magnitude of confounding in observational studies is to compare estimates with and without adjustment for a covariate, but this strategy is known to be defective for noncollapsible measures such as the odds ratio. Comparing estimates from marginal structural and standard logistic regression models, the total difference between crude and conditional effects can be decomposed into the sum of a noncollapsibility effect and confounding bias. We provide an analytic approach to assess the noncollapsibility effect in a point-exposure study and provide a general formula for expressing the noncollapsibility effect. Next, we provide a graphical approach that illustrates the relationship between the noncollapsibility effect and the baseline risk, and reveals the behavior of the noncollapsibility effect for a range of different exposure and covariate effects. Various observations about noncollapsibility can be made from the different scenarios with or without confounding; for example, the magnitude of effect of the covariate plays a more important role in the noncollapsibility effect than does that of the effect of the exposure. In order to explore the noncollapsibility effect of the odds ratio in the presence of time-varying confounding, we simulated an observational cohort study. The magnitude of noncollapsibility was generally comparable to the effect in the point-exposure study in our simulation settings. Finally, in an applied example we demonstrate that collapsibility can have an important impact on estimation in practice.},

abstract = {This study sought to determine whether very low birth weight (VLBW) infants ({\textless} 1500 gm) with fetal cocaine exposure differed from non-cocaine-exposed VLBW infants in incidence of neonatal medical complications and in later developmental outcome. Forty-one cocaine-exposed, VLBW infants, followed in a longitudinal study, were compared with 41 non-cocaine-exposed, VLBW infants of comparable race, social class, age, and incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Cocaine-exposed infants were identified on the basis of combined findings of maternal and/or infant urine immunoassay and on the basis of maternal self-report. At birth, groups did not differ on medical risk factors except that cocaine-exposed infants had a higher incidence of mild (grades I to II) intraventricular hemorrhage. Cocaine-using women were also more likely to use other drugs, especially alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco. At follow-up, at mean corrected ages of 16.5 +/- 8 months for 30 cocaine-exposed infants and 18.5 +/- 7 months for 37 non-cocaine-exposed infants, standardized assessments of cognitive (Mental Development Index) and motor (Psychomotor Development Index) development were administered. Cocaine-exposed infants had lower mean cognitive (83 +/- 27 vs 91 +/- 19), and motor (85 +/- 25 vs 96 +/- 18) scores; the incidence of developmental delay was significantly higher even after control for the effects of intraventricular hemorrhage and chronologic age. Cocaine-exposed VLBW infants were also more likely to be living with relatives or in foster homes. We conclude that these VLBW, cocaine-exposed infants were at increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, were more likely to be placed outside maternal care, and had higher incidences of cognitive and motor delays at follow-up.},

abstract = {Summary. Experimentation is a powerful methodology that enables scientists to establish causal claims empirically. However, one important criticism is that experiments merely provide a black box view of causality and fail to identify causal mechanisms. Specifically, critics argue that, although experiments can identify average causal effects, they cannot explain the process through which such effects come about. If true, this represents a serious limitation of experimentation, especially for social and medical science research that strives to identify causal mechanisms. We consider several experimental designs that help to identify average natural indirect effects. Some of these designs require the perfect manipulation of an intermediate variable, whereas others can be used even when only imperfect manipulation is possible. We use recent social science experiments to illustrate the key ideas that underlie each of the designs proposed.},

2,3,7,8-TCDD


p. 64 -- info on accident

"2,3,7,8-TCDD is thought to be the most toxic PCDD congener, followed in presumed toxicity by the higher chlorinated PCDDs."

"Studies on the interactions of 2,3,7,8-TCDD with a variety of hormone systems have demonstrated that a number of links exist, in particular to the sex steroids, corticosteroids, and thyroid hormones."

"Poland and Glover (1979) studied the dose-response relationship for thymic atrophy produced by 2,3,7,8-TCDD in two strains of mice. C57BL/6 mice, which have a high-affinity Ah receptor, were approximately 10-fold more sensitive to thymic involution than DBA/2 mice, which have a lower-affinity receptor."

"The present of the Ah receptor and the protein Arnt was demonstrated in T cells, and a combined exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD and the T-cell activator anti-CD3 caused the Ah receptor to translocate to the nucleus, but DNA binding activity of the murine T-call Ah receptor was not detected (Lawrence, et al., 1996)."

"The toxic effects elicited by 2,3,7,8-TCDD and other PCDDs are accompanied by modulation of numerous biochemical responses in target tissues and organs. Although there is extensive support for the role of the intracellular dioxin or aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor in mediating pCDD-induced biochemical and toxic effects, the direct link between a series of biochemical alterations and any specific toxicity is unclear."

"As outlined below, intracellular signal transduction by PCDDs and PCDFs, most notably 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF, is mediated by the Ah receptor. This protein is a ubiquitous regulatory factor that binds 2,3,7,8-TCDD and its planar aromatic congeners in a saturable manner and with high affinity... At the molecular level, high-affinity Ah receptor ligands such as 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF are very potent inducers of transcription of a distinct network of target genes encoding xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as CYp1A1, CYp1A2, and ...."

"Binding affinities of individual PCDDs to the Ah receptor are strongest for those congeners having a 2,3,7,8-chlorine substitution pattern, with 2,3,7,8-TCDD being the most potent."

"Across and within species, the Ah-receptor binding affinities for, e.g., 2,3,7,8-TCDD can vary by one or two orders of magnitude. For example, in both man and mouse, two forms of Ah receptor have been identified which show a 5-10-fold difference in binding affinity for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. In the human forms, one has a K{\_}d for 2,3,7,8-TCDD of 0.4 nM, while the other form has a K{\_}d of about 2 nM. In addition, variability in Ah-receptor binding is influenced by the cell type, tissue, sex, age, experimental conditions and assay used."

"The Ah receptor is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of gene regulatory proteins. The bHLH motif represents a well studied dimerization and DNA-binding domain common to a large group of regulatory factors that are generally involved in cell growth and differentiation..."

"The receptor functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that, upon exposure to ligand, recognizes DNA of target genes as a heterodimeric complex with the structurally related factor Arnt.."

"The ligand-activated Ah receptor-Arnt complex induces transcription of target promoters bia potent transactivation domains that are contained within the C-terminus of both the Ah receptor and Arnt.... The Ah receptor may also modulate biochemical and cellular responses via non-DNA dependent mechanisms."

"2,3,7,8-TCDD inhibits aromotase (CYP19) activity in the human choriocarcinoma cell line Jeg-3. The EC-50 cvlue for inhibition was in in the same range as that observed for CYP1A1 induction in this cell type (Drenth et al., 1996). This action could be a cause for the anti-oestrogenic effectsof PCDDs; these in-vitro results need to be confirmed in in-vivo experiments."

"Data on births in Zone A between April 1977 (nine months after the accident) and Decempber 1984 showed a significant excess of female births: 48 females versus 26 males (Mocarelli et al., 1996)... Parents with an excess of female offspring were reported to have had a high 2,3,7,8-TCDD serum concentration in 1976."

"Many of the developmental effects of 2,3,7,8-TCDD, such as clefting of the external genitalia, resemble those seen with high doses of oestrogens."

"Rhesus monkeys were exposed to 0, 5, or 25 ng/kg 2,3,7,8-TCDD in their diet for four years and then help for up to an additional 10 years, when laparascopic surgery was performed. Both the incidence and severity of endometriosis were increased in a dose-dependent manner (Rier et al., 1993). These findings have been supported by results from surgically induced endometriosis in both rats and mice (Cummings, et al., 1996).... The highest dose of 2,3,7,8-TCDD was associated wtih ovarian atrophy and a decrease in the endometriotic response. This is not unexpected, since promotion of endometriosis requires oestrogen (Cummings and Metcalf, 1995)...."

"Thus, while oestrogen is required for PCDD-induced promotion of endometriosis, the decrease in circulating oestradiol levels suggests an antioestrogenic effect of 2,3,7,8-TCDD."

However, the programs also should target women who are drinking during pregnancy, to increase their likelihood of having healthy babies in the current as well as subsequent pregnancies."


"As 80 percent of the pregnancies in the study population are unplanned and the women do not begin prenatal care until the second semester, the warning label reaches them before health care providers do."

"women who are older and have had multiple children tend to drink more than younger women who have not had children"

"women who needed the warning the most, those drinking at risk levels, did not change the amount of alcohol they consumed after the warning label was implemented."

"One explanation is that 71{\%} of the risk drinkers had been pregnant before. Although we were blinded to the outcome of the women's births, we hypothesize that the women believe (rightly or wrongly) that their babies are healthy). Women in the study were asked how often it was safe to drink while pregnant and how likely it was that their baby would be healthy if they drank alcohol at risk levels. Responses suggest that pregnant women who previously gave birth to babies are more likely to feel safe drinking daily and to believe their future babies will be healthy if they drink heavily during pregnancy than do women who never gave birth."

abstract = {Young maternal age has been associated with an increased risk of gastroschisis, while high maternal weight status has been associated with a decreased risk. We were interested in investigating the joint effect of these two risk factors to identify thresholds in risk associated with body mass index (BMI) for a given age. Data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study included 464 case infants with gastroschisis and 4842 healthy controls. A generalised additive model with a bivariate spline for continuous maternal age and prepregnancy BMI was used to model the probability of gastroschisis. The bivariate spline in BMI and maternal age was significantly associated with gastroschisis (P = 0.0001) after adjustment for study centre, maternal race/ethnicity, education, income and number of persons supported by income, smoking, alcohol use, vitamin use, vasoconstrictor medication use and gestational diabetes. The data indicate that women who are younger and who have lower BMI are at the greatest risk; a woman with a BMI of 17 who gives birth at age 15 has 7 times the odds (adjusted odds ratio = 7.0 [95{\%} CI 4.2, 11.5]) of having an offspring with gastroschisis compared with a woman of age 24 with a BMI of 23. Furthermore, there was an interaction between maternal age and BMI for this risk. The increased risk of low maternal age and prepregnancy BMI associated with gastroschisis appears to suggest an aetiological role related to biological immaturity for this particular birth defect.},

When the mediator is mis-measured, the validity of mediation analysis can be severely undermined. In this paper, we first study the bias of classical, non-differential measurement error on a continuous mediator in the estimation of direct and indirect causal effects in generalized linear models when the outcome is either continuous or discrete and exposure-mediator interaction may be present. Our theoretical results as well as a numerical study demonstrate that in the presence of non-linearities, the bias of naive estimators for direct and indirect effects that ignore measurement error can take unintuitive directions. We then develop methods to correct for measurement error. Three correction approaches using method of moments, regression calibration, and SIMEX are compared. We apply the proposed method to the Massachusetts General Hospital lung cancer study to evaluate the effect of genetic variants mediated through smoking on lung cancer risk.},

On average, disruptive behavior decreased from age 3.5 to 6.0. Child sex and maternal depression/anxiety related to the level of behavior problems but not to the rate of change. Boys and children of more depressed/anxious mothers exhibited higher levels of disruptive behavior.

abstract = {Nutrients and growth factors regulate brain development during fetal and early postnatal life. The rapidly developing brain is more vulnerable to nutrient insufficiency yet also demonstrates its greatest degree of plasticity. Certain nutrients have greater effects on brain development than do others. These include protein, energy, certain fats, iron, zinc, copper, iodine, selenium, vitamin A, choline, and folate. The effect of any nutrient deficiency or overabundance on brain development will be governed by the principle of timing, dose, and duration. The ability to detect the specific effects of nutrient deficiencies is  dependent on knowing which area of the brain is preferentially affected and on having neurologic assessments that tap into the functions of those specific areas. As examples, protein-energy malnutrition causes both global deficits, which are testable by general developmental testing, and area-specific effects on the hippocampus and the cortex. Iron deficiency alters myelination, monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis, and hippocampal energy metabolism in the neonatal period. Assessments of these effects could include tests for speed of processing  (myelination), changes in motor and affect (monoamines), and recognition memory (hippocampus). Zinc deficiency alters autonomic nervous system regulation and hippocampal and cerebellar development. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are important for synaptogenesis, membrane function, and, potentially, myelination. Overall, circuit-specific behavioral and neuroimaging tests are being developed for use in progressively younger infants to more accurately assess the effect of nutrient deficits both while the subject is deficient and after recovery from the deficiency.},

"The effect of any nutrient deficiency or overabundance on brain development will be governed by the principle of timing, dose, and duration."

"On balance, the brain's vulnerability to nutritional insults likely outweighs its plasticity, which explains why early nutritional insults result in brain dysfunction not only while the nutrient is in deficit, but also after repletion."

"The effect of nutrient deficiency or supplementation on the developing brain is a function of the brain's requirement for a nutrient in specific metabolic pathways and structural components"

"The hippocampus that subserves recognition memory behavior is one of the earliest areas to show cortical-cortical connectivity and functionality"

"Nutrients are necessary not only for neurons but also for supporting glial cells. For any given region, early nutritional insults have a greater effect on cell proliferation, thereby affecting cell number. Later nutritional insults affect differentiation, including size, complexity, and in the case of neurons, synaptogenesis and dendritic arborization."

The 60 women with confirmed pelvic endometriosis constituted the endometriosis group, and the other 20 women without endometriosis constituted the control group. Preoperative blood samples were obtained for serum biomarker measurements. Serum levels of nine different serum biomarkers including ??-enolase, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, leptin, interleukin-8, anti-endometrial antibody, phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1, CA125, syntaxin-5, and laminin-1 were measured concurrently and compared between the control and endometriosis groups, and among control group and endometriosis subgroups including stage I, stage II, stage III and stage IV endometriosis. Results The serum levels of ??-enolase, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, leptin, interleukin-8 and antiendometrial antibodies showed a statistically significant difference neither between control and endometriosis groups nor among control group and endometriosis subgroups. The serum levels of CA125, syntaxin-5 and laminin-1 showed a statistically significant difference both between the control and endometriosis groups (p {\textless} 0.01) and among control group and endometriosis subgroups (p {\textless} 0.01). Serum levels of laminin-1 in stage II and IV endometriosis; syntaxin-5 in stage I and II endometriosis; and CA125 in stage III and IV endometriosis were found to have the different levels compared to control group. Conclusions These findings show that the concurrent measurement of CA125, syntaxin-5 and laminin-1 might be a useful non-invasive test in strengthening the diagnosis of endometriosis and in predicting its severity. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

antenatal depression -- assessed between second and third trimesters

Bayley scales at 6 months







Gestational age is an important confounder in the association between maternal antenatal depression and infant development. A delay in infant development may be related to a shorter gestational period caused by maternal depression during pregnancy. 







For example, one report from a large cohort study, the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children (AL- SPAC) [6], showed that antenatal depression influences child development independently of postnatal depression. The ALSPAC study also found that anxiety during preg- nancy continues to affect child development 4 years after birth [7]. Another study exploring mothers who were pregnant at the time of a tornado disaster in Canada revealed the impact of strong objective stress during pregnancy on the IQ and language capability of infants [5]. 







Although we found no significant relation between antenatal EPDS and MDI or PDI in our linear regression analyses, 







Although a trend of association between maternal antenatal depression and infant devel- opment was found in the univariable analysis, this corre- lation was lost in the multivariable analyses. 
















depression during pregnancy was significantly related to shorter gestational age and that shorter gestational age was significantly related to developmental delay in infant cog- nitive function. Therefore, gestational age can be consid- ered to be an important confounder in the association between maternal antenatal depression and infant mental development.},

abstract = {Breastfeeding rates in the U.S. are socially patterned. Previous research has documented startling racial and socioeconomic disparities in infant feeding practices. However, much of the empirical evidence regarding the effects of breastfeeding on long-term child health and wellbeing does not adequately address the high degree of selection into breastfeeding. To address this important shortcoming, we employ sibling comparisons in conjunction with 25 years of panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to approximate a natural experiment and more accurately estimate what a particular child's outcome would be if he/she had been differently fed during infancy. Results from standard multiple regression models suggest that children aged 4 to 14 who were breast- as opposed to bottle-fed did significantly better on 10 of the 11 outcomes studied. Once we restrict analyses to siblings and incorporate within-family fixed effects, estimates of the association between breastfeeding and all but one indicator of child health and wellbeing dramatically decrease and fail to maintain statistical significance. Our results suggest that much of the beneficial long-term effects typically attributed to breastfeeding, per se, may primarily be due to selection pressures into infant feeding practices along key demographic characteristics such as race and socioeconomic status. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article examined emotion competence in children exposed to domestic violence (DV). It also examined the hypothesis that children's emotional competence mediates relations between DV and children's later difficulties with peers and behavioral adjustment. DV was assessed when children were at the age of five, emotional competence was assessed at the age of 9.5, and peer quality and behavioral adjustment were obtained at the age of 11. Children from homes with greater DV were less aware of their own emotions and more emotionally dysregulated at the age of 9.5. Emotional awareness mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's friendship closeness and internalizing problems at the age of 11. Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's negative peer group interactions, social problems, and internalizing and externalizing problems at the age of 11. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of DV on children's emotional development and the role that different aspects of emotional competence play in children's socio-emotional adjustment.

abstract = {Internalizing problems in preschool have been found to predict later anxiety and depressive disorders, and outcomes may vary according to children's gender. Preschool children's transitions to school pose additional risks, as this developmental period is associated with increased social and cognitive demands. Despite the significance of this age group and the long-term implications associated with early internalizing symptoms, most studies have focused on early behavior problems; relatively few have examined early precursors of internalizing disorders. One potential risk factor, particularly during the preschool-to-school age transition, is emotion dysregulation. Specifically, emotion overregulation, or excessive control of emotions, is ill-defined in current literature but may be associated with later internalizing outcomes. Therefore, in the present study, operational definitions of emotion overregulation were examined and clarified. Structural equation modeling analyses were also conducted to investigate both concurrent and longitudinal relationships between overregulation, negative parenting, and internalizing outcome variables. The potential roles of social context and gender in relationships with children's adjustment were also explored. Participants were 235 children (113 girls) at elevated risk for behavior problems. Children's emotion dysregulation was assessed using a multi-method approach: (1) laboratory-based behavioral task; (2) mothers' reports of children's emotion overregulation-related temperament; and (3) teachers' reports of children's emotion dysregulated behavior. Negative parenting behaviors were assessed via maternal parenting questionnaires. Mothers and teachers reported on child internalizing outcomes at ages 3, 6, and 10 years. Our analysis revealed several interesting pathways between predictor variables and internalizing outcomes. In particular, several emotion overregulation variables predicted internalizing behaviors concurrently and longitudinally, and negative parenting predicted internalizing behaviors across time. Shy temperament, negative parenting, and internalizing behaviors were also stable from preschool to kindergarten, and prediction models also suggested temporal stability of these variables from preschool to late school-age. As expected, some differences between mother- and teacher-reported outcomes were found, suggesting the importance of examining multiple contexts. Although gender was not a significant moderator in the proposed model relationships, unique gender-related findings were revealed. Results are discussed with respect to the value of multi-contextual, multi-level analyses of children's early emotion regulation abilities and parenting behaviors for prevention of internalizing behavior problems.

However, previous studies have provided a limited view on the variety of factors that commonly co-occur in these environments (e.g., other characteristics of the parents and family) and how they may collectively impact children. Knowing this information could have implications for parental interventions aimed at preventing the continuation or initiation of psychosocial problems in children. Thus, the present study simultaneously examined the association between father-perpetrated interparental aggression, father characteristics, and child psychosocial functioning in a sample of 145 men arrested for domestic violence. Results showed that of all the variables examined, paternal antisocial personality traits and interpersonal hostility were uniquely associated with overall child psychosocial impairment, externalizing problems, and attention problems. Implications for intervention programs are discussed.},

The current study examined discrepancies between mothers' and children's reports of child emotion regulation. This investigation examined patterns of discrepancies for key aspects of emotion regulation (i.e., inhibition and dysregulated expression) and for three emotions (anger, sadness, worry). A total of 61 mother-child dyads (mean children's age = 9.3 years) participated. As hypothesized, discrepancies for inhibition subscales were of a larger magnitude than those for dysregulated expression subscales. Furthermore, age was related to discrepancies in both anger subscales, parent reports of child externalizing symptoms were related to anger dysregulated expression discrepancies, and child reports of internalizing symptoms were related to sadness dysregulated expression discrepancies. Overall, the findings suggest that patterns of discrepant reports are not random but rather may provide meaningful and useful information about the nature of emotion regulation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Educational settings provide a great source of diverse emotions which need to be regulated. To examine the complex relations between emotional, cognitive and motivational aspects of learning, appropriate measures of emotion regulation in an academic context are mandatory. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a psychometrically sound and contextually specific multidimensional self-report instrument aimed at assessing the specific emotion regulation strategies that students predominantly implement in various academic situations. Based on the theoretical assumptions of the process model of emotion regulation and a series of four empirical studies conducted on separate samples of high-school and university students (N1 = 20, N2 = 1030, N3 = 359 and N4 = 230), by combining both qualitative and quantitative data, the Academic Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (AERQ) was designed. The instrument contains 8 scales, each measuring a separate emotion regulation strategy: avoiding situations, developing competences, redirecting attention, reappraisal, suppression, respiration, venting, and seeking social support. All scales had adequate psychometric characteristics and were meaningfully related to the external variables examined (i.e. gender, cognitive appraisals, achievement emotions, academic achievement and goal orientations).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Child Behavior Checklist Juvenile Bipolar Disorder (CBCL-JBD) profile and Posttraumatic Stress Problems (CBCL-PTSP) scale have been used to assess juvenile bipolar disorder (JBD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. However, their validity is questionable according to previous research. Both measures are associated with severe psychopathology often encompassing multiple DSM-IV diagnoses. Further, children who score highly on one of these scales often have elevated scores on the other, independent of PTSD or JBD diagnoses. We hypothesized that the two scales may be indicators of a single syndrome related to dysregulated mood, attention, and behavior. We aimed to describe and identify the overlap between the CBCL-JBD profile and CBCL-PTSP scales. METHOD: Two thousand and twenty-nine (2029) children from a nationally representative sample (1073 boys, 956 girls; mean age = 11.98; age range = 6-18) were rated on emotional and behavior problems by their parents using the CBCL. Comparative model testing via structural equation modeling was conducted to determine whether the CBCL-JBD profile and CBCL-PTSP scale are best described as measuring separate versus unitary constructs. Associations with suicidality and competency scores were also examined. RESULTS: The CBCL-JBD and CBCL-PTSP demonstrated a high degree of overlap (r = .89) at the latent variable level. The best fitting, most parsimonious model was one in which the CBCL-JBD and CBCL-PTSP items identified a single latent construct, which was associated with higher parental endorsement of child suicidal behavior, and lower functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The CBCL-JBD profile and CBCL-PTSP scale overlap to a remarkable degree, and may be best described as measures of a single syndrome. This syndrome appears to be related to severe psychopathology, but may not conform to traditional DSM-IV classification. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the utility of the CBCL-JBD and CBCL-PTSP profiles, and offer promising methods of empirically based measurement of disordered self-regulation in youth.},

The majority (76{\%}) of adolescents reported witnessing or being victimized by at least 1 violent event in the prior 6 months. Nearly half of adolescents who had talked about their experience of a violent event reported feeling constrained from sharing their thoughts or feelings because of others' reactions. After controlling for daily hassles, more exposure to violence was associated with more self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms. Exposure to violence was not a significant predictor of teachers' ratings of adaptive functioning or internalizing symptoms. Support from specific individuals, perceived school safety, and lower constraints for discussing violence showed protective effects in the relation between exposure to violence and specific dimensions of psychological functioning.

Regression analyses of child and adult measures of child's emotion self-regulation and callous- unemotional traits, and a child measure of moral emotions, showed that poor emotion regulation, along with low levels of guilt and high levels of shame, predicted children's externalizing behaviors, while only low levels of guilt predicted a unique subset of child characteristics called callous-unemotional traits. Children who experienced healthy guilt for misdeeds were better able to control their behavior. Adults noted the ability of children with callous/ unemotional traits to manage and regulate their emotions, while poor emotion regulation was more predictive of the cluster of externalizing problems.

Participants were 80 parent-adolescent dyads (mean age = 13.6; 79 {\%} African-American and 17 {\%} Caucasian) with diverse family composition and socioeconomic status. Parent and adolescent dyads self-reported on their emotion regulation difficulties and adolescents reported on their perceptions of parent invalidation (i.e., punishment and neglect) of emotions and their own internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results showed that parents who reported higher levels of emotion dysregulation tended to invalidate their adolescent's emotional expressions more often, which in turn related to higher levels of adolescent emotion dysregulation. Additionally, adolescent-reported emotion dysregulation mediated the relation between parent invalidation of emotions and adolescent internalizing and externalizing behaviors.

abstract = {Numerous studies have reported substantive correlations between indicators of parenting, children's emotion regulation (ER), and children's psychosocial adjustment. However, studies on underlying mechanisms are scarce. Particularly in early adolescence, it is still unclear whether relations between parenting and ER are caused by adolescent behavior, by parent behavior, or by reciprocal processes. Moreover, it is unclear whether ER can be seen as an antecedent or a consequence of psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this study was to examine predictive relations among parenting and adolescents' ER, and adolescents' ER and psychosocial adjustment, respectively. We collected longitudinal, multiple informant data at two measurement occasions (Grade 6, Grade 7). All told, 1,100 adolescents (10-14 years) and their parents filled out questionnaires assessing responsiveness and psychological control, adolescents' anger regulation, and adolescents' problem and prosocial behavior. Cross-lagged analyses revealed reciprocal effects between parenting, ER, and adjustment for the parent and boys', but not for the girls', report. Moreover, relations were different for adolescents with versus without clinically elevated symptoms of psychopathology. Our findings support the assumption that reciprocal relations between parenting, ER, and psychosocial adjustment are likely to persist until early adolescence. Nevertheless, the moderating role of gender and psychopathology should be taken into account. Possible reasons for the different findings, and practical implications, are discussed.},

abstract = {A community-based intervention with specific factors for children and parents exposed to interparental violence (IPV) was compared with a control intervention based on non-specific factors. We hypothesized that participation in an intervention with specific factors, focused on IPV, parenting and coping, would be associated with better recovery. IPV exposed children and parents were group randomized over a specific factors- and control intervention. Baseline, posttest and follow-up measurements of 155 parents and children (aged 6-12 years, 55.5{\%} boys) were fitted in a multilevel model. Outcomes were parent and teacher reported children's internalizing and externalizing problems (CBCL, TRF), child self-reported depressive symptoms (CDI) and parent and child reported children's post-traumatic stress symptoms (TSCYC, TSCC). Based on intention-to-treat and completer analyses, children in the specific factors intervention did not show better recovery than children in the control intervention. Children in both interventions decreased significantly in parent-reported children's internalizing and externalizing problems and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Children reported a decrease in their mean level of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Teachers reported a decrease in internalizing problems, but not in externalizing problems. No association between time since exposure and level and course of symptoms was found. Treatment differentiation was assessed and both programs were significantly different on hypothesized effective factors. Higher treatment adherence in both programs did not result in a larger difference in recovery. IPV exposed children improve over the course and after participating in a community-based child- and parent program, but specific factors in intervention may not carry additional benefits when implemented in community settings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Children completed measures of security and anxiety. Mothers and fathers' completed measures of violence perpetrated toward their partners and general hostility. Results of a Bayesian mediation model revealed indirect effects such that after controlling for other variables in the model, fathers' hostility was associated with greater emotional reactivity, which in turn was associated with children's reports of worrying. The indirect effects of mothers' hostility, parents' interparental violence, and child age on children's reports of worrying via children's emotional reactivity were not statistically significant.

abstract = {Educational settings provide a great source of diverse emotions which need to be regulated. To examine the complex relations between emotional, cognitive and motivational aspects of learning, appropriate measures of emotion regulation in an academic context are mandatory. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a psychometrically sound and contextually specific multidimensional self-report instrument aimed at assessing the specific emotion regulation strategies that students predominantly implement in various academic situations. Based on the theoretical assumptions of the process model of emotion regulation and a series of four empirical studies conducted on separate samples of high-school and university students (N1 = 20, N2 = 1030, N3 = 359 and N4 = 230), by combining both qualitative and quantitative data, the Academic Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (AERQ) was designed. The instrument contains 8 scales, each measuring a separate emotion regulation strategy: avoiding situations, developing competences, redirecting attention, reappraisal, suppression, respiration, venting, and seeking social support. All scales had adequate psychometric characteristics and were meaningfully related to the external variables examined (i.e. gender, cognitive appraisals, achievement emotions, academic achievement and goal orientations).},

The results indicated that the internal consistency was acceptable for most EATQ-R temperament scales. Further, principal components analysis of the instrument yielded a structure with nine components, which generally reflected the temperament scales of the EATQ-R. The test– retest stability of the scale was moderate to good, whereas the parent–child agreement was rather low. Finally, the scale correlated in a theoretically meaningful way with children's self-reports of personality and psychopathology. It can be concluded that the EATQ-R is a useful scale for measuring aspects of reactive and regulative temperament in children and adolescents, although there is certainly room for improving the instrument.},

abstract = {Background: Children who witness interparental violence are at a heightened risk for developing psychosocial, behavioral and cognitive problems, as well as posttraumatic stress symptoms. For these children the psycho-educational secondary prevention program 'En nu ik...!' ('It's my turn now!') has been developed. This program includes specific therapeutic factors focused on emotion awareness and expression, increasing feelings of emotional security, teaching specific coping strategies, developing a trauma narrative, improving parent-child interaction and psycho-education. The main study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the specific therapeutic factors in the program. A secondary objective is to study mediating and moderating factors.Methods/design: This study is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial across cities in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 140) are referred to the secondary preventive intervention program by police, social work, women shelters and youth (mental health) care. Children, aged 6-12 years, and their parents, who experienced interparental violence are randomly assigned to either the intervention program or the control program. The control program is comparable on nonspecific factors by offering positive attention, positive expectations, recreation, distraction, warmth and empathy of the therapist, and social support among group participants, in ways that are similar to the intervention program. Primary outcome measures are posttraumatic stress symptoms and emotional and behavioral problems of the child. Mediators tested are the ability to differentiate and express emotions, emotional security, coping strategies, feelings of guilt and parent-child interaction. Mental health of the parent, parenting stress, disturbances in parent-child attachment, duration and severity of the domestic violence and demographics are examined for their moderating effect. Data are collected one week before the program starts (T1), and one week (T2) and six months (T3) after finishing the program. Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses will be done.Discussion: Adverse outcomes after witnessing interparental violence are highly diverse and may be explained by multiple risk factors. An important question for prevention programs is therefore to what extent a specific focus on potential psychotrauma is useful. This trial may point to several directions for optimizing public health response to children's exposure to interparental violence.Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR3064. {\textcopyright} 2012 Overbeek et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {A retrospective survey of undergraduate students was used to examine the long-term psychological impact of witnessing interparental physical aggression during childhood. Two hundred and three of 1,452 young adults surveyed (14{\%}) reported witnessing as children at least one incident of physical aggression between their parents. Both men and women who witnessed interparental physical conflict reported higher levels of current psychological distress than a comparison group of young adults who never observed physical aggression between their parents. This group difference remained even after controlling for parental divorce, parental SES, physical abuse of the child, parental alcoholism, and nonphysical discord witnessed between parents. Additional analyses found that the negative effect of witnessing interparental aggression was intensified when the aggression was serious enough to warrant some type of outside assistance for the victim and when the parent of the same-sex was seen being victimized. Although these findings provided support for the theory that witnessing interparental physical aggression is a traumatic experience that may have long-term psychological ramifications, we also found that a substantial proportion of the variance accounted for in adult adjustment by interparental physical conflict was mediated through decreased parental caring and warmth during childhood. Implications for these results, limitations of the present study, and directions for further research are discussed.},

It also examined the hypothesis that children's emotional competence mediates relations between DV and children's later difficulties with peers and behavioral adjustment. DV was assessed when children were at the age of five, emotional competence was assessed at the age of 9.5, and peer quality and behavioral adjustment were obtained at the age of 11. Children from homes with greater DV were less aware of their own emotions and more emotionally dysregulated at the age of 9.5. Emotional awareness mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's friendship closeness and internalizing problems at the age of 11. Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's negative peer group interactions, social problems, and internalizing and externalizing problems at the age of 11.

Emotion regulation was assessed using the experience sampling method, in which adolescents provided multiple reports about the intensity, lability, and strategies used to regulate negative emotions across 1 week. Adolescents also completed self-report measures of adjustment. Adolescents who reported more intense and labile emotions and less effective regulation of these emotions also reported more depressive symptoms and problem behavior. Responding to negative emotions with disengagement (e.g., denial) or involuntary engagement (e.g., rumination) was less effective in regulating negative affect, and greater use of these strategies was related to higher levels of depressive symptoms and problem behavior.},

Regression analyses of child and adult measures of child's emotion self-regulation and callous- unemotional traits, and a child measure of moral emotions, showed that poor emotion regulation, along with low levels of guilt and high levels of shame, predicted children's externalizing behaviors, while only low levels of guilt predicted a unique subset of child characteristics called callous-unemotional traits. Children who experienced healthy guilt for misdeeds were better able to control their behavior. Adults noted the ability of children with callous/ unemotional traits to manage and regulate their emotions, while poor emotion regulation was more predictive of the cluster of externalizing problems.

The indirect effects of mothers' hostility, parents' interparental violence, and child age on children's reports of worrying via children's emotional reactivity were not statistically significant.

Abstract: Fifty-six mothers and their 24-month-old toddlers were observed on two occasions in a series of laboratory procedures designed to assess relations between emotional functioning (emotional reactivity and emotion regulation) in an individual assessment and social behavior with a same-sex peer. Emotional reactivity was assessed using two frustration tasks designed to elicit distress. Emotional regulation was assessed by examining the child's behaviors (venting, distraction, focal-object focus, self-orientation, and mother-orientation) when confronted by the two distress-eliciting tasks. Peer play behaviors were coded for social participation and peer-directed conflict (aggressive) behavior. The results indicated that both emotional reactivity and emotion regulation were important predictors of at least two types of social behavior: conflict and cooperation. Distress to frustration, when accompanied by high venting or high focal-object focus, was significantly related to conflict with peers but not when accompanied by distraction, mother-orientation or self-focused behaviors. These findings are discussed in terms of the adaptive value of emotion regulation skills in early development, and the importance of identifying the causal relations between child regulation and early social competence.},

The current paper uses a developmental psychopathology perspective to examine conditions commonly comorbid with ADHD during late childhood through adolescence. First, we present evidence for ADHD and comorbid disorders. Next, we discuss emotion regulation and its associations with ADHD. The role of parenting behaviors in the development and maintenance of emotion regulation difficulties and comorbid disorders among children with ADHD is explored. An illustrative example of emotion regulation and parenting over the course of development is provided to demonstrate bidirectional relations among these constructs. We then present an integrated conceptual model of emotion regulation as a shared risk process that may lead to different comorbid conditions among children with ADHD.

This study reports on the psychometric evaluation of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA), a revision of the adult measure. The ERQ-CA was evaluated with a sample of 827 participants aged between 10 and 18 years. Results indicate sound internal consistency as well as stability over a 12-month period. Sound construct and convergent validity are also demonstrated. It is concluded that the ERQ-CA is a valid age-appropriate measure for investigating the use of 2 specific strategies of ER during the childhood and adolescence developmental periods.},

Additionally, unique associations between exposure to community violence and reactive and proactive aggression, two widely-studied forms of aggression, in the context of parental involvement has yet to be examined. One population that may be of particular interest for such an investigation is immigrant adolescents, a population at increased risk of experiencing community violence and developing aggression. The current study therefore examined the joint and interactive contribution of community violence and parental involvement in the explanation of reactive and proactive forms of aggression among 81 immigrant adolescents (M age = 15.44). As expected, exposure to community violence was positively associated with both reactive and proactive aggression. Parental involvement, however, was not associated with either form of aggression. Further, the association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression was found to vary by level of parental involvement. Contrary to expectations, when levels of parental involvement were high, there was a positive association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression and no association when levels of parental involvement were low. Results have important implications for understanding unique developmental pathways and distinct correlates of reactive and proactive aggression among immigrant adolescents.

The current study examined discrepancies between mothers' and children's reports of child emotion regulation. This investigation examined patterns of discrepancies for key aspects of emotion regulation (i.e., inhibition and dysregulated expression) and for three emotions (anger, sadness, worry). A total of 61 mother-child dyads (mean children's age = 9.3 years) participated. As hypothesized, discrepancies for inhibition subscales were of a larger magnitude than those for dysregulated expression subscales. Furthermore, age was related to discrepancies in both anger subscales, parent reports of child externalizing symptoms were related to anger dysregulated expression discrepancies, and child reports of internalizing symptoms were related to sadness dysregulated expression discrepancies. Overall, the findings suggest that patterns of discrepant reports are not random but rather may provide meaningful and useful information about the nature of emotion regulation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Internalizing problems in preschool have been found to predict later anxiety and depressive disorders, and outcomes may vary according to children's gender. Preschool children's transitions to school pose additional risks, as this developmental period is associated with increased social and cognitive demands. Despite the significance of this age group and the long-term implications associated with early internalizing symptoms, most studies have focused on early behavior problems; relatively few have examined early precursors of internalizing disorders. One potential risk factor, particularly during the preschool-to-school age transition, is emotion dysregulation. Specifically, emotion overregulation, or excessive control of emotions, is ill-defined in current literature but may be associated with later internalizing outcomes. Therefore, in the present study, operational definitions of emotion overregulation were examined and clarified. Structural equation modeling analyses were also conducted to investigate both concurrent and longitudinal relationships between overregulation, negative parenting, and internalizing outcome variables. The potential roles of social context and gender in relationships with children's adjustment were also explored. Participants were 235 children (113 girls) at elevated risk for behavior problems. Children's emotion dysregulation was assessed using a multi-method approach: (1) laboratory-based behavioral task; (2) mothers' reports of children's emotion overregulation-related temperament; and (3) teachers' reports of children's emotion dysregulated behavior. Negative parenting behaviors were assessed via maternal parenting questionnaires. Mothers and teachers reported on child internalizing outcomes at ages 3, 6, and 10 years. Our analysis revealed several interesting pathways between predictor variables and internalizing outcomes. In particular, several emotion overregulation variables predicted internalizing behaviors concurrently and longitudinally, and negative parenting predicted internalizing behaviors across time. Shy temperament, negative parenting, and internalizing behaviors were also stable from preschool to kindergarten, and prediction models also suggested temporal stability of these variables from preschool to late school-age. As expected, some differences between mother- and teacher-reported outcomes were found, suggesting the importance of examining multiple contexts. Although gender was not a significant moderator in the proposed model relationships, unique gender-related findings were revealed. Results are discussed with respect to the value of multi-contextual, multi-level analyses of children's early emotion regulation abilities and parenting behaviors for prevention of internalizing behavior problems.

abstract = {Emotion regulation has emerged as a popular topic, but there is doubt about its viability as a scientific construct. This article identifies conceptual and methodological challenges in this area of study and describes exemplar studies that provide a substantive basis for inferring emotion regulation. On the basis of those studies, 4 methods are described that provide compelling evidence for emotion regulation: independent measurement of activated emotion and purported regulatory processes; analysis of temporal relations; measurement across contrasting conditions; and multiple, convergent measures. By offering this perspective, this article aims to engage thoughtful debate and critical analysis, with the goal of increasing methodological rigor and advancing an understanding of emotion regulation as a scientific construct},

abstract = {Background: Children who witness interparental violence are at a heightened risk for developing psychosocial, behavioral and cognitive problems, as well as posttraumatic stress symptoms. For these children the psycho-educational secondary prevention program 'En nu ik...!' ('It's my turn now!') has been developed. This program includes specific therapeutic factors focused on emotion awareness and expression, increasing feelings of emotional security, teaching specific coping strategies, developing a trauma narrative, improving parent-child interaction and psycho-education. The main study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the specific therapeutic factors in the program. A secondary objective is to study mediating and moderating factors.Methods/design: This study is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial across cities in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 140) are referred to the secondary preventive intervention program by police, social work, women shelters and youth (mental health) care. Children, aged 6-12 years, and their parents, who experienced interparental violence are randomly assigned to either the intervention program or the control program. The control program is comparable on nonspecific factors by offering positive attention, positive expectations, recreation, distraction, warmth and empathy of the therapist, and social support among group participants, in ways that are similar to the intervention program. Primary outcome measures are posttraumatic stress symptoms and emotional and behavioral problems of the child. Mediators tested are the ability to differentiate and express emotions, emotional security, coping strategies, feelings of guilt and parent-child interaction. Mental health of the parent, parenting stress, disturbances in parent-child attachment, duration and severity of the domestic violence and demographics are examined for their moderating effect. Data are collected one week before the program starts (T1), and one week (T2) and six months (T3) after finishing the program. Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses will be done.Discussion: Adverse outcomes after witnessing interparental violence are highly diverse and may be explained by multiple risk factors. An important question for prevention programs is therefore to what extent a specific focus on potential psychotrauma is useful. This trial may point to several directions for optimizing public health response to children's exposure to interparental violence.Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR3064. {\textcopyright} 2012 Overbeek et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The Polyvagal Theory introduced a new perspective relating autonomic function to behavior that included an appreciation of autonomic nervous system as a “system,” the identification of neural circuits involved in the regulation of autonomic state, and an interpretation of autonomic reactivity as adaptive within the context of the phylogeny of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system. The paper has two objectives: First, to provide an explicit statement of the theory; and second, to introduce the features of a polyvagal perspective. The polyvagal perspective emphasizes how an understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms and phylogenetic shifts in neural regulation, leads to different questions, paradigms, explanations, and conclusions regarding autonomic function in biobehavioral processes than peripheral models. Foremost, the polyvagal perspective emphasizes the importance of phylogenetic changes in the neural structures regulating the autonomic nervous system and how these phylogenetic shifts provide insights into the adaptive function and the neural regulation of the two vagal systems.},

abstract = {Although exposure to community violence and parental involvement have been previously found to independently predict aggressive behaviors, the interaction effect is less clear. Additionally, unique associations between exposure to community violence and reactive and proactive aggression, two widely-studied forms of aggression, in the context of parental involvement has yet to be examined. One population that may be of particular interest for such an investigation is immigrant adolescents, a population at increased risk of experiencing community violence and developing aggression. The current study therefore examined the joint and interactive contribution of community violence and parental involvement in the explanation of reactive and proactive forms of aggression among 81 immigrant adolescents (M age = 15.44). As expected, exposure to community violence was positively associated with both reactive and proactive aggression. Parental involvement, however, was not associated with either form of aggression. Further, the association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression was found to vary by level of parental involvement. Contrary to expectations, when levels of parental involvement were high, there was a positive association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression and no association when levels of parental involvement were low. Results have important implications for understanding unique developmental pathways and distinct correlates of reactive and proactive aggression among immigrant adolescents.

abstract = {Numerous studies have reported substantive correlations between indicators of parenting, children's emotion regulation (ER), and children's psychosocial adjustment. However, studies on underlying mechanisms are scarce. Particularly in early adolescence, it is still unclear whether relations between parenting and ER are caused by adolescent behavior, by parent behavior, or by reciprocal processes. Moreover, it is unclear whether ER can be seen as an antecedent or a consequence of psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this study was to examine predictive relations among parenting and adolescents' ER, and adolescents' ER and psychosocial adjustment, respectively. We collected longitudinal, multiple informant data at two measurement occasions (Grade 6, Grade 7). All told, 1,100 adolescents (10-14 years) and their parents filled out questionnaires assessing responsiveness and psychological control, adolescents' anger regulation, and adolescents' problem and prosocial behavior. Cross-lagged analyses revealed reciprocal effects between parenting, ER, and adjustment for the parent and boys', but not for the girls', report. Moreover, relations were different for adolescents with versus without clinically elevated symptoms of psychopathology. Our findings support the assumption that reciprocal relations between parenting, ER, and psychosocial adjustment are likely to persist until early adolescence. Nevertheless, the moderating role of gender and psychopathology should be taken into account. Possible reasons for the different findings, and practical implications, are discussed.},

Aggressive, in comparison to nonaggressive, delinquents reported more self-serving distortions in reference to overt behavior content. In contrast, self-debasing cognitive content was related to internalizing problems, as both the AI and NI groups had more negative beliefs about self than both the AN and NN groups, and more negative beliefs about the world and the future than the NN group. The AI group also had more negative beliefs about the world than the AN group. Self-debasing processing distortions were not specifically related to internalizing problems, as no differences emerged between the AN and NI groups; however, the AI group differed from the NN group on 3 of 4 types of these distortions. Both of the internalizing groups had a more negative attributional style than the NN group. Theoretical and treatment implications are highlighted.},

Method: A community sample of 642 Spanish adolescents aged 12-18 responded to the DERS. Results: Factor analysis suggested a six-factor solution, and strict measurement invariance across sex was achieved. Internal consistency for the subscales was moderate to satisfactory (.71-.88), except for Awareness (? = .62). We found some sex differences on subscale scores, with small effect sizes.

abstract = {This study examined recent exposure to violence in the community and in other settings, protective factors, and current psychological functioning among 349 young adolescents from 9 urban middle schools. The majority (76{\%}) of adolescents reported witnessing or being victimized by at least 1 violent event in the prior 6 months. Nearly half of adolescents who had talked about their experience of a violent event reported feeling constrained from sharing their thoughts or feelings because of others' reactions. After controlling for daily hassles, more exposure to violence was associated with more self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms. Exposure to violence was not a significant predictor of teachers' ratings of adaptive functioning or internalizing symptoms. Support from specific individuals, perceived school safety, and lower constraints for discussing violence showed protective effects in the relation between exposure to violence and specific dimensions of psychological functioning. The implications of this research for school-based interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {This study examined the association between the security of attachment and processes influencing the development of emotion regulation in young children. A sample of 73 4 1/2-year-olds and their mothers were observed in an emotion regulation probe involving mild frustration for children, and mothers and children were later independently interviewed about how the child had felt. Fewer than half the mothers agreed with children's self-reports in the emotion they attributed to children (a lower rate than the concordance of observer ratings with children's self-reports), and higher mother-child concordance was associated with secure attachment and mother's beliefs about the importance of attending to and accepting their own emotions. Mother-child conversations about recent events evoking children's negative emotion were also analyzed. Children were less likely to avoid conversing about negative feelings when they were in secure attachments and when mothers were more validating of the child's perspective. Children's greater understanding of negative emotions was also significantly associated with higher mother-child concordance and less child conversational avoidance. Taken together, these findings underscore the multiple influences of attachment on emotion regulation and the importance of children's emotion understanding to these processes.},

@article{Henning1997a,
abstract = {A retrospective survey of undergraduate students was used to examine the long-term psychological impact of witnessing interparental physical aggression during childhood. Two hundred and three of 1,452 young adults surveyed (14{\%}) reported witnessing as children at least one incident of physical aggression between their parents. Both men and women who witnessed interparental physical conflict reported higher levels of current psychological distress than a comparison group of young adults who never observed physical aggression between their parents. This group difference remained even after controlling for parental divorce, parental SES, physical abuse of the child, parental alcoholism, and nonphysical discord witnessed between parents. Additional analyses found that the negative effect of witnessing interparental aggression was intensified when the aggression was serious enough to warrant some type of outside assistance for the victim and when the parent of the same-sex was seen being victimized. Although these findings provided support for the theory that witnessing interparental physical aggression is a traumatic experience that may have long-term psychological ramifications, we also found that a substantial proportion of the variance accounted for in adult adjustment by interparental physical conflict was mediated through decreased parental caring and warmth during childhood. Implications for these results, limitations of the present study, and directions for further research are discussed.},

Facial expressivity during the induction was used to identify 3 ER groups: inexpressive, modulated expressive, and highly expressive. Group differences in ER were significantly related to heart rate and skin conductance. Inexpressive preschoolers had the highest heart rate, lowest vagal tone, and smallest autonomic nervous system (ANS) change during the induction. Highly expressive preschoolers had the slowest heart rate, highest vagal tone, and largest ANS change. The inexpressive and highly expressive groups had more externalizing symptoms than the modulated group at preschool age and at follow-up at the end of 1st grade. Inexpressive preschoolers appeared to have more depressed and anxious symptoms at follow-up.},

In Study 1, Q-scales for emotion regulation and autonomy were developed, and analyses supported their discriminant validity. Study 2 further explored the construct validity of the Emotion Regulation Q-Scale within a sample of 143 maltreated and 80 impoverished children, aged 6 to 12 years. A multitrait-multimethod matrix and confirmatory factor analyses indicated impressive convergence among the Emotion Regulation Q-Scale and established measures of affect regulation. This new scale also was discriminable from measures of related constructs, including Q-sort assessments of ego resiliency. The use of this new measure was further supported by its ability to distinguish between maltreated and comparison children and between groups of well-regulated versus dysregulated children.},

abstract = {Developmental research on emotion regulation is increasingly advancing toward a systems view that integrates behavioral and biological constituents of emotional self-control. However, this view poses fundamental challenges to prevailing conceptualizations of emotion regulation. In portraying emotion regulation as a network of multilevel processes characterized by feedback and interaction between higher and lower systems, it becomes increasingly apparent that emotion regulation is a component of (rather than a response to) emotional activation, that it derives from the mutual influence of multiple emotion-related systems (rather than the maturation of higher control processes alone), and that it sometimes contributes to maladaptive behavioral outcomes, especially in conditions of environmental adversity. The implications of this perspective for the developmental study of emotion regulation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

abstract = {It is well established that children in homes where interparental violence is present are at increased risk for psychosocial (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, and attention) difficulties. However, previous studies have provided a limited view on the variety of factors that commonly co-occur in these environments (e.g., other characteristics of the parents and family) and how they may collectively impact children. Knowing this information could have implications for parental interventions aimed at preventing the continuation or initiation of psychosocial problems in children. Thus, the present study simultaneously examined the association between father-perpetrated interparental aggression, father characteristics, and child psychosocial functioning in a sample of 145 men arrested for domestic violence. Results showed that of all the variables examined, paternal antisocial personality traits and interpersonal hostility were uniquely associated with overall child psychosocial impairment, externalizing problems, and attention problems. Implications for intervention programs are discussed.},
